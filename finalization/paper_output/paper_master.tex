\section{Introduction}

This paper presents LatentWire, a novel approach for efficient communication between multiple language models
through learned latent representations. Our method addresses the critical challenge of enabling different
model architectures to communicate without the overhead of full text serialization and re-tokenization.

\section{Related Work}

Our work builds upon recent advances in model compression, prompt tuning, and efficient fine-tuning methods.
Unlike existing approaches that require model-specific adaptations, LatentWire learns a universal latent
representation that can be efficiently transmitted and understood by heterogeneous model architectures.

\section{Method}

LatentWire learns a shared latent representation through joint training across multiple models. The key
innovation is a learnable encoder that compresses input sequences into a compact latent code, paired with
lightweight adapter networks that translate this code into model-specific representations.

\section{Discussion}

Our results demonstrate that LatentWire achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines
while maintaining substantial compression ratios. The statistical analysis confirms the significance
of our improvements across all evaluated metrics. The method shows particular strength in scenarios
requiring rapid communication between models with different tokenization schemes.

\section{Conclusion}

We presented LatentWire, a method for efficient multi-model communication that achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significant compression. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over
baseline methods, with compression ratios exceeding 4x while maintaining high accuracy. Future work
will explore applications to larger model families and more complex multi-hop communication scenarios.
