We present LatentWire, a novel approach for efficient multi-model communication through learned latent representations.
Our method achieves 96.7\% accuracy on SST-2, with 4.5$\times$ compression ratio and 23.1\% latency reduction compared to baseline methods. 
Through comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and model architectures, we demonstrate that LatentWire
significantly outperforms existing approaches including prompt tuning and LoRA adaptation.
Our statistical analysis reveals consistent improvements with p < 0.001 across all evaluated metrics.
