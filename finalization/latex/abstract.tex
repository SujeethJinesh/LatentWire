We present Telepathy, a neural bridge architecture that enables direct communication between heterogeneous Large Language Models through learned soft tokens, eliminating autoregressive text generation entirely.
Our approach achieves 94.7\% accuracy on SST-2 sentiment analysis, 88.9\% on AG News topic classification, and 94.5\% on TREC-6 question classification—outperforming text-relay baselines by 20-37 percentage points while operating 22$\times$ faster (37ms vs. 835ms per sample).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we identify that cross-attention is essential for cross-model transfer, while simpler pooling approaches fail completely.
We also present LatentWire, our initial failed attempt at universal text communication that motivated Telepathy's focused approach.
Our work demonstrates that learned continuous representations can serve as an efficient wire protocol between frozen heterogeneous LLMs.
