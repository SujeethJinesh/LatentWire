\section{Results}

\subsection{Main Results}

Table~\ref{tab:main_results} presents our main experimental results across datasets and methods.
LatentWire consistently achieves the highest accuracy while maintaining substantial compression ratios.


On AG News, LatentWire achieves 90.7\% accuracy. On SST-2, LatentWire achieves 96.7\% accuracy. On TREC, LatentWire achieves 95.3\% accuracy. 

\subsection{Statistical Significance}

We performed comprehensive statistical testing using paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons. All reported improvements are statistically significant (p < 0.05).

\subsection{Efficiency Analysis}

Our analysis shows the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.
LatentWire achieves Pareto-optimal performance, providing the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off.
