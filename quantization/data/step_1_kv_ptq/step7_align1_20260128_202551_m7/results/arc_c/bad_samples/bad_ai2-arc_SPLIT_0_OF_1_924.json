    "question": "A scientist investigated how well plants native to Maryland would grow in desert conditions. The scientist placed equal amounts of desert soil into 10 identical containers. Each container held two of the same kind of plant. The scientist investigated a total of 10 different kinds of plants. The scientist placed all of the containers into a greenhouse adjusted to produce hot, desert-like conditions .The scientist gave the plants equal, but small amounts of water for the next five weeks. Most of the plants did not survive after the five week investigation. Which statement best explains why 16 of the plants did not survive?",
