================ Example IO (SPLIT_0_OF_1) ================
[Input with chat template]:
<|im_start|>user
Accurately answer the following question:

An astronomer observes that a planet rotates faster after a meteorite impact. Which is the most likely effect of this increase in rotation?

Choices:
A. Planetary density will decrease.
B. Planetary years will become longer.
C. Planetary days will become shorter.
D. Planetary gravity will become stronger.


Instructions:
- Carefully read the question and all options.
- Select the single most correct answer.
- Respond ONLY in the following format: "The correct answer is A/B/C/D".
- Do not include any explanations, additional text, or punctuation besides the answer.

The correct answer is<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>
