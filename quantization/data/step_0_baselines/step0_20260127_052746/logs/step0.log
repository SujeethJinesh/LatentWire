================ Example IO (SPLIT_0_OF_1) ================
[Input with chat template]:
<|im_start|>user
Accurately answer the following question:

An astronomer observes that a planet rotates faster after a meteorite impact. Which is the most likely effect of this increase in rotation?

Choices:
A. Planetary density will decrease.
B. Planetary years will become longer.
C. Planetary days will become shorter.
D. Planetary gravity will become stronger.


Instructions:
- Carefully read the question and all options.
- Select the single most correct answer.
- Respond ONLY in the following format: "The correct answer is A/B/C/D".
- Do not include any explanations, additional text, or punctuation besides the answer.

The correct answer is<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>

================ Example IO (SPLIT_0_OF_1) ================
[Input with chat template]:
<|im_start|>user
Accurately answer the following question:

In a population of brown snakes, a snake is born with a white-spotted pattern. Which factor will have the most influence on whether this trait will become common in the brown snake population?

Choices:
A. the ability of the snake to survive to reproduce
B. the appearance of other new traits in the baby snake
C. the history of the pattern in previous snake populations
D. the presence of thermal energy changing the snake pattern


Instructions:
- Carefully read the question and all options.
- Select the single most correct answer.
- Respond ONLY in the following format: "The correct answer is A/B/C/D".
- Do not include any explanations, additional text, or punctuation besides the answer.
