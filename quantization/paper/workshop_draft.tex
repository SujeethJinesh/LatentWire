\title{Quantized Cache-to-Cache: Communication-Budgeted KV Transfer for Heterogeneous LLMs}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We study precision-aware communication between heterogeneous LLMs by quantizing KV-cache transfers in Cache-to-Cache (C2C). Our goal is to reduce bandwidth and memory while preserving accuracy. We present post-training quantization and cache-length reduction, and show accuracy vs bytes transmitted curves. This draft contains placeholders for results.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Large language models (LLMs) often communicate via text, which is slow and lossy. Cache-to-Cache (C2C) communicates via KV-cache projection and fusion, but does not address precision constraints. We ask: \textit{How low can KV precision go before accuracy collapses, and can we recover performance under tight bandwidth budgets?}

\section{Background and Motivation}
C2C projects sharer KV caches into receiver space and fuses them with learned gates. This retains richer semantics than text relay. However, KV caches are large: they scale with sequence length, heads, and hidden size. Quantization and cache-length reduction can shrink the communication footprint.

\section{Method}
\subsection{Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)}
We quantize the KV caches using INT8 or INT4/NF4 with per-head scaling. We evaluate accuracy and latency under fixed precision budgets.

\subsection{Cache-Length Reduction}
We prune KV tokens using a fixed ratio (e.g., top-50\%, 25\%, 10\%), reducing transmitted bytes further.

\subsection{Communication-Budget Curves}
We report accuracy as a function of transmitted bytes, enabling fair comparison under equal communication constraints.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Setup}
We evaluate on OpenBookQA and ARC-C with a Qwen3-0.6B receiver and Qwen2.5-0.5B sharer. All models are frozen; only the projector is trained when QAT is enabled.

\subsection{Main Results}
We report preliminary cache-length pruning results from INT8 PTQ runs. Baseline FP16/INT8/INT4 full runs are currently partial (100/169 samples) and are omitted here; we will re-run them to match the full 500/1150 sample counts.

\section{Discussion}
Quantized C2C provides large bandwidth reductions with limited accuracy drop. Cache pruning further improves the tradeoff, suggesting a practical path to deployable multi-LLM communication.

\section{Conclusion}
We introduce precision-aware C2C and report accuracy vs bytes curves. This establishes a communication-budget perspective for cross-model KV transfer and opens the door to low-latency, low-bandwidth agent collaboration.
