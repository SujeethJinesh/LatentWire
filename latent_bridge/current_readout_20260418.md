# RotAlign-KV Current Readout — 2026-04-18

## Headline

We are **not ICLR-main-paper ready yet**.

The strongest surviving result is now a **pair-conditioned calibrated sparse
key-head budget prior** on the Qwen2.5-0.5B -> Qwen3-0.6B control pair. That
result survives a matched shuffled-prior null and beats the older uniform
sparse baseline on GSM8K, but it does **not** transfer cleanly to DeepSeek and
it does **not** replicate as a clear win on SVAMP.

## Strongest Positive Regime

Qwen2.5-0.5B -> Qwen3-0.6B, sparse `k_only`, `gate=0.10`,
`position_selection_ratio=0.5`, fixed calibration-derived per-head budget prior:

- `gsm8k_eval_70`: `0.085714`
- `gsm8k_100`: `0.070000`
- `gsm8k_100` shuffled-prior null: `0.040000`
- `gsm8k_100` uniform sparse baseline: `0.050000`
- `gsm8k_100` target alone: `0.040000`
- `gsm8k_100` text-to-text: `0.100000`

Interpretation:

- The gain is **not** explained by generic sparsity or any uneven head budget.
- The specific calibrated head assignment matters.
- The effect is still narrower than text-to-text and therefore not yet a
  replacement for token communication.

## Transfer Read

Saved-prior transfer on `gsm8k_eval_70`:

- Qwen prior -> Qwen target: `0.085714`
- Qwen prior -> DeepSeek target: `0.014286`
- DeepSeek prior -> DeepSeek target: `0.014286`
- DeepSeek prior -> Qwen target: `0.057143`

Interpretation:

- The fixed-prior story is **asymmetric**.
- The strong Qwen-native prior does not transfer to DeepSeek.
- The DeepSeek-native prior is weak on DeepSeek and only partially lifts Qwen.
- The defensible claim is **pair-conditioned calibrated head budgeting**, not a
  universal transferable prior.

## Second Reasoning Task

SVAMP, same Qwen pair and same fixed head-prior branch:

- fixed head prior: `0.071429`
- shuffled-prior null: `0.042857`
- prior vs shuffled: delta `+0.0286`, method-only wins `4`, baseline-only wins
  `2`, bootstrap `[-0.0286, +0.1000]`, McNemar `0.6831`
- previous target-alone baseline on the same SVAMP split:
  `0.071429`
- previous text-to-text baseline on the same SVAMP split:
  `0.414286`

Interpretation:

- On SVAMP, the calibrated prior is better than a matched blind null.
- But it only recovers to **target-alone**, not beyond it.
- So SVAMP is currently a **boundary condition**, not a second positive
  replication.

## What Survives

- `k_only` matters more than `v_only`.
- Sparse selection matters more than dense transport.
- The strongest current branch is head-budgeted and calibration-derived.
- Reviewer-proof nulls matter:
  - zero-byte attenuation
  - random translated
  - shuffled selector / shuffled prior
  - translated-only
  - text-to-text
- Cross-family transfer is still weak.

## What This Means For The Paper

Best honest claim today:

> Calibrated sparse key-head budgets can improve cross-model latent transport on
> a compatible same-family pair under matched bandwidth, but the effect is
> pair-conditioned, asymmetric, and not yet a broad reasoning benchmark win.

That is strong enough for a tighter workshop story and promising for a main
paper only if the next replication steps succeed.

## Next Highest-Value Steps

1. Budget sweep for the fixed-prior branch: `0.25 / 0.50 / 0.75`, each with
   shuffled-prior and uniform baselines.
2. Three-seed repeat on the positive GSM branch.
3. Next method pivots from the new literature:
   - shrinkage-regularized head priors
   - entropy / causal head scoring
   - retrieval-head-only routing
   - attention-logit-preserving head ranking
4. Keep SVAMP, ARC, and cross-family transfer in the paper as explicit failure
   boundaries.
