Filtering for Partially Known Dynamics
Guy Revach, Nir Shlezinger, Xiaoyong Ni, Adri `a L ´opez Escoriza, Ruud J. G. van Sloun, and Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract—State estimation of dynamical systems in real-time
is a fundamental task in signal processing. For systems that are
well-represented by a fully known linear Gaussian state space
(SS) model, the celebrated Kalman ﬁlter (KF) is a low complexity
optimal solution. However, both linearity of the underlying SS
model and accurate knowledge of it are often not encountered in
practice. Here, we present KalmanNet, a real-time state estimator
that learns from data to carry out Kalman ﬁltering under non-
linear dynamics with partial information. By incorporating the
structural SS model with a dedicated recurrent neural network
module in the ﬂow of the KF, we retain data efﬁciency and
interpretability of the classic algorithm while implicitly learn-
ing complex dynamics from data. We demonstrate numerically
that KalmanNet overcomes non-linearities and model mismatch,
outperforming classic ﬁltering methods operating with both
mismatched and accurate domain knowledge.
I. I NTRODUCTION
Estimating the hidden state of a dynamical system from
noisy observations in real-time is one of the most fundamental
tasks in signal processing and control, with applications in
localization, tracking, and navigation [2]. In a pioneering work
from the early 1960s [3]–[5], based on work by Wiener from
1949 [6], Rudolf Kalman introduced the Kalman ﬁlter (KF),
a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator that is
applicable to time-varying systems in discrete-time, which
are characterized by a linear state space (SS) model with
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The low-complexity
implementation of the KF, combined with its sound theoretical
basis, resulted in it quickly becoming the leading workhorse
of state estimation in systems that are well described by SS
models in discrete-time. The KF has been applied to problems
such as radar target tracking [7], trajectory estimation of
ballistic missiles [8], and estimating the position and velocity
of a space vehicle in the Apollo program [9].
While the original KF assumes linear SS models, many
problems encountered in practice are governed by non-linear
dynamical equations. Therefore, shortly after the introduction
of the original KF, non-linear variations of it were proposed,
such as the extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) [7], [8] and the

unscented Kalman ﬁlter (UKF) [10]. Methods based on se-
quential Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling, such as the family
of particle ﬁlters (PFs) [11]–[13], were introduced for state
estimation in non-linear, non-Gaussian SS models. To date,
the KF and its non-linear variants are still widely used for
online ﬁltering in numerous real world applications involving
tracking and localization [14].
The common thread among these aforementioned ﬁlters
is that they are model-based (MB) algorithms; namely, they
rely on accurate knowledge and modeling of the underlying
dynamics as a fully characterized SS model. As such, the
performance of these MB methods critically depends on the
validity of the domain knowledge and model assumptions.
MB ﬁltering algorithms designed to cope with some level
of uncertainty in the SS models, e.g., [15]–[17], are rarely
capable of achieving the performance of MB ﬁltering with
full domain knowledge, and rely on some knowledge of how
much their postulated model deviates from the true one. In
many practical use cases the underlying dynamics of the
system is non-linear, complex, and difﬁcult to accurately
characterize as a tractable SS model, in which case degradation
in performance of the MB state estimators is expected.
Recent years have witnessed remarkable empirical success
of deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-life applications.
These data-driven (DD) parametric models were shown to
be able to catch the subtleties of complex processes and
replace the need to explicitly characterize the domain of
interest [18], [19]. Therefore, an alternative strategy to imple-
ment state estimation—without requiring explicit and accurate
knowledge of the SS model—is to learn this task from data
using deep learning. DNNs such as recurrent neural networks
(RNNs)—i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM) [20] and gated
recurrent units (GRUs) [21]—and attention mechanisms [22]
have been shown to perform very well for time series related
tasks mostly in intractable environments, by training these
networks in an end-to-end, model-agnostic manner from a
large quantity of data. Nonetheless, DNNs do not incorpo-
rate domain knowledge such as structured SS models in a
principled manner. Consequently, these DD approaches require
many trainable parameters and large data sets even for simple
sequences [23] and lack the interpretability of MB methods.
These constraints limit the use of highly parametrized DNNs
for real-time state estimation in applications embedded in
hardware-limited mobile devices such as drones and vehicular
systems.
The limitations of MB Kalman ﬁltering and DD state
estimation motivate a hybrid approach that exploits the best
of both worlds; i.e., the soundness and low complexity of the

classic KF, and the model-agnostic nature of DNNs. Therefore,
we build upon the success of our previous work in MB
deep learning for signal processing and digital communication
applications [24]–[27] to propose a hybrid MB/DD online
recursive ﬁlter, coined KalmanNet. In particular, we focus on
real-time state estimation for continuous-value SS models for
which the KF and its variants are designed. We assume that
the noise statistics are unknown and the underlying SS model
is partially known or approximated from a physical model
of the system dynamics. To design KalmanNet, we identify
the Kalman gain (KG) computation of the KF as a critical
component encapsulating the dependency on noise statistics
and domain knowledge, and replace it with a compact RNN
of limited complexity that is integrated into the KF ﬂow. The
resulting system uses labeled data to learn to carry out Kalman
ﬁltering in a supervised manner.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
1) We design KalmanNet, which is an interpretable, low
complexity, and data-efﬁcient DNN-aided real-time state
estimator. KalmanNet builds upon the ﬂow and theoret-
ical principles of the KF, incorporating partial domain
knowledge of the underlying SS model in its operation.
2) By learning the KG, KalmanNet circumvents the depen-
dency of the KF on knowledge of the underlying noise
statistics, thus bypassing numerically problematic matrix
inversions involved in the KF equations and overcoming
the need for tailored solutions for non-linear systems; e.g.,
approximations to handle non-linearities as in the EKF.
3) We show that KalmanNet learns to carry out Kalman
ﬁltering from data in a manner that is invariant to the
sequence length. Speciﬁcally, we present an efﬁcient
supervised training scheme that enables KalmanNet to
operate with arbitrary long trajectories while only training
using short trajectories.
4) We evaluate KalmanNet in various SS models. The
experimental scenarios include synthetic setups, tracking
the chaotic Lorenz system, and localization using the
Michigan NCLT data set [28]. KalmanNet is shown to
converge much faster compared with purely DD systems,
while outperforming the MB EKF, UKF, and PF, when
facing model mismatch and dominant non-linearities.
The proposed KalmanNet leverages data and partial domain
knowledge to learn the ﬁltering operation , rather than using
data to explicitly estimate the missing SS model parameters.
Although there is a large body of work that combines SS
models with DNNs, e.g., [29]–[35], these approaches are
sometimes used for different SS related tasks (e.g., smoothing,
imputation); with a different focus, e.g., incorporating high-
dimensional visual observations to a KF; or under different
assumptions, as we discuss in detail below.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
reviews the SS model and its associated tasks, and discusses
related works. Section III details the proposed KalmanNet.
Section IV presents the numerical study. Section V provides
concluding remarks and future work.
Throughout the paper, we use boldface lower-case letters
for vectors and boldface upper-case letters for matrices. The
transpose,ℓ2 norm, and stochastic expectation are denoted by
{·}⊤,∥·∥, and E [·], respectively. The Gaussian distribution
with meanµ and covariance Σ is denoted byN (µ, Σ). Finally,
R and Z are the sets of real and integer numbers, respectively.
II. S YSTEM MODEL AND PRELIMINARIES
A. State Space Model
We consider dynamical systems characterized by a SS
model in discrete-time [36]. We focus on (possibly) non-linear,
Gaussian, and continuous SS models, which for each t∈ Z
are represented via
xt = f (xt−1) + wt, wt∼N (0, Q), xt∈ Rm, (1a)
yt = h (xt) + vt, vt∼N (0, R), yt∈ Rn. (1b)
In (1a), xt is the latent state vector of the system at time t,
which evolves from the previous state xt−1, by a (possibly)
non-linear, state-evolution function f (·) and by an AWGN
wt with covariance matrix Q. In (1b), yt is the vector of
observations at time t, which is generated from the current
latent state vector by a (possibly) non-linear observation (emis-
sion) mapping h (·) corrupted byAWGN vt with covariance
R. For the special case where the evolution or the observation
transformations are linear, there exist matrices F, H such that
f (xt−1) = F· xt−1, h (xt) = H· xt. (2)
In practice, the state-evolution model (1a) is determined by
the complex dynamics of the underlying system, while the
observation model (1b) is dictated by the type and quality of
the observations. For instance, xt can determine the location,
velocity, and acceleration of a vehicle, while yt are measure-
ments obtained from several sensors. The parameters of these
models may be unknown and often require the introduction
of dedicated mechanisms for their estimation in real-time
[37], [38]. In some scenarios, one is likely to have access
to an approximated or mismatched characterization of the
underlying dynamics.
SS models are studied in the context of several differ-
ent tasks; these tasks are different in their nature, and can
be roughly classiﬁed into two main categories: observation
approximation and hidden state recovery. The ﬁrst category
deals with approximating parts of the observed signal yt.
This can correspond, for example, to the prediction of future
observations given past observations; the generation of missing
observations in a given block via imputation; and the denoising
of the observations. The second category considers the recov-
ery of a hidden state vector xt. This family of state recovery
tasks includes ofﬂine recovery, also referred to as smoothing,
where one must recover a block of hidden state vectors, given
a block of observations, e.g., [35]. The focus of this paper is
ﬁltering; i.e., online recovery of xt from past and current noisy
observations{yτ}t
τ=1. For a given x0, ﬁltering involves the
design of a mapping from yt to ˆxt,∀t∈{ 1, 2,...,T } ≜T ,
where T is the time horizon.
B. Data-Aided Filtering Problem Formulation
The ﬁltering problem is at the core of real-time tracking.
Here, one must provide an instantaneous estimate of the state
2

<!-- page 3 -->

xt based on each incoming observationyt in an online manner.
Our main focus is on scenarios where one has partial knowl-
edge of the SS model that describes the underlying dynamics.
Namely, we know (or have an approximation of) the state-
evolution (transition) function f (·) and the state-observation
(emission) function h (·). For real world applications, this
knowledge is derived from our understating of the system
dynamics, its physical design, and the model of the sensors. As
opposed to the classical assumptions in KF, the noise statistics
Q and R are not known. More speciﬁcally, we assume:
• Knowledge of the distribution of the noise signals wt and
vt is not available.
• The functions f (·) and h (·) may constitute an approxi-
mation of the true underlying dynamics. Such approxima-
tions can correspond, for instance, to the representation
of continuous time dynamics in discrete time, acquisition
using misaligned sensors, and other forms of mismatches.
While we focus on ﬁltering in partially known SS models,
we assume that we have access to a labeled data set containing
a sequence of observations and their corresponding ground
truth states. In various scenarios of interest, one can assume
access to some ground truth measurements in the design stage.
For example, in ﬁeld experiments it is possible to add extra
sensors both internally or externally to collect the ground truth
needed for training. It is also possible to compute the ground
truth data using ofﬂine and more computationally intensive
algorithms. Finally, the inference complexity of the learned
ﬁlter should be of the same order (and preferably smaller) as
that of MB ﬁlters, such as the EKF.
C. Related Work
A key ingredient in recursive Bayesian ﬁltering is theupdate
operation; namely, the need to update the prior estimate using
new observed information. For linear Gaussian SS using the
KF, this boils down to computing the KG. While the KF
assumes linear SS models, many problems encountered in
practice are governed by non-linear dynamics, for which one
should resort to approximations. Several extensions of the
KF were proposed to deal with non-linearities. The EKF
[7], [8] is a quasi-linear algorithm based on an analytical
linearization of the SS model. More recent non-linear vari-
ations are based on numerical integration: UKF [10], the
Gauss-Hermite Quadrature [39], and the Cubature KF [40].
For more complex SS models, and when the noise cannot
be modeled as Gaussian, multiple variants of the PF were
proposed that are based on sequential MC [11]–[13], [41]–
[45]. These MC algorithms are considered to be asymptotically
exact but relatively computationally heavy when compared
to Kalman-based algorithms. These MB algorithms require
accurate knowledge of the SS model, and their performance
is typically degrades in the presence of model mismatch.
The combination of machine learning and SS models, and
speciﬁcally Kalman-based algorithms, is the focus of growing
research attention. To frame the current work in the context of
existing literature, we focus on the approaches that preserve
the general structure of the SS model. The conventional
approach to deal with partially known SS models is to im-
pose a parametric model and then estimate its parameters.
This can be achieved by jointly learning the parameters and
state sequence using expectation maximization [46]–[48] and
Bayesian probabilistic algorithms [37], [38], or by selecting
from a set of a priori known models [49]. When training
data is available, it is commonly used to tune the missing
parameters in advance, in a supervised or an unsupervised
manner, as done in [50]–[52]. The main drawback of these
strategies is that they are restricted to an imposed parametric
model on the underlying dynamics (e.g., Gaussian noises).
When one can bound the uncertainty in the SS model in
advance, an alternative approach to learning is to minimize
the worst-case estimation error among all expected SS models.
Such robust variations were proposed for various state estima-
tion algorithms, including Kalman variants [15]–[17], [53] and
particle ﬁlters [54], [55]. The fact that these approaches aim
to design the ﬁlter to be suitable for multiple different SS
models typically results in degraded performance compared
to operating with known dynamics.
When the underlying system’s dynamics are complex and
only partially known or the emission model is intractable and
cannot be captured in a closed form—e.g., visual observations
as in a computer vision task [56]—one can resort to approxi-
mations and to the use of DNNs. Variational inference [57]–
[59] is commonly used in connection with SS models, as in
[29]–[31], [33], [34], by casting the Bayesian inference task
to optimization of a parameterized posterior and maximizing
an objective. Such approaches cannot typically be applied
directly to state recovery in real-time, as we consider here,
and the learning procedure tends to be complex and prone to
approximation errors.
A common strategy when using DNNs is to encode the
observations into some latent space that is assumed to obey a
simple SS model, typically a linear Gaussian one, and track
the state in the latent domain as in [56], [60], [61], or to
use DNNs to estimate the parameters of the SS model as in
[62], [63]. Tracking in the latent space can also be extended by
applying a DNN decoder to the estimated state to return to the
observations domain, while training the overall system end-to-
end [31], [64]. The latter allows to design trainable systems
for recovering missing observations and predicting future ones
by assuming that the temporal relationship can be captured
as an SS model in the latent space. This form of DNN-
aided systems is typically designed for unknown or highly
complex SS models, while we focus in this work on setups
with partial domain knowledge, as detailed in Subsection II-B.
Another approach is to combine RNNs [65], or variational
inference [32], [66] with MC based sampling. Also related is
the work [35], which used learned models in parallel with MBs
algorithms operating with full knowledge of the SS model,
applying a graph neural network in parallel to the Kalman
smoother to improve its accuracy via neural augmentation.
Estimation was performed by an iterative message passing
over the entire time horizon. This approach is suitable for the
smoothing task and is computationally intensive, and so may
not be suitable for real-time ﬁltering [67].

D. Model-Based Kalman Filtering
Our proposed KalmanNet, detailed in the following section,
is based on the MB KF, which is a linear recursive estimator.
In every time step t, the KF produces a new estimate xt using
only the previous estimate ˆxt−1 as a sufﬁcient statistic and the
new observation yt. As a result, the computational complexity
of the KF does not grow in time. We ﬁrst describe the original
algorithm for linear SS models, as in (2), and then discuss how
it is extended into the EKF for non-linear SS models.
The KF can be described by a two-step procedure: predic-
tion and update, where in each time step t∈T , it computes
the ﬁrst- and second-order statistical moments.
1) The ﬁrst step predicts the current a priori statistical
moments based on the previous a posteriori estimates.
Speciﬁcally, the moments of x are computed using the
knowledge of the evolution matrix F as
ˆxt|t−1 = F· ˆxt−1|t−1, (3a)
Σt|t−1 = F· Σt−1|t−1· F⊤ + Q (3b)
and the moments of the observations y are computed
based on the knowledge of the observation matrix H as
ˆyt|t−1 = H· ˆxt|t−1 (4a)
St|t−1 = H· Σt|t−1· H⊤ + R. (4b)
2) In the update step, the a posteriori state moments are
computed based on the a priori moments as
ˆxt|t = ˆxt|t−1 + Kt· ∆yt (5a)
Σt|t = Σt|t−1− Kt· St|t−1· K⊤
t . (5b)
Here, Kt is the KG, and it is given by
Kt = Σt|t−1· H⊤· S−1
t|t−1. (6)
The term ∆yt is the innovation; i.e., the difference
between the predicted observation and the observed value,
and it is the only term that depends on the observed data
∆yt = yt− ˆyt|t−1. (7)
The EKF extends the KF for non-linear f (·) and/or h (·), as
in (1). Here, the ﬁrst-order statistical moments (3a) and (4a)
are replaced with
ˆxt|t−1 = f (ˆxt−1), (8a)
ˆyt|t−1 = h
(ˆxt|t−1
)
, (8b)
respectively. The second-order moments, though, cannot be
propagated through the non-linearity, and must thus be ap-
proximated. The EKF linearizes the differentiable f (·) and
h (·) in a time-dependent manner using their partial derivative
matrices, also known as Jacobians, evaluated at ˆxt−1|t−1 and
ˆxt|t−1 . Namely,
ˆFt =Jf
(ˆxt−1|t−1
)
(9a)
ˆHt =Jh
(ˆxt|t−1
)
, (9b)
where ˆFt is plugged into (3b) and ˆHt is used in (4b) and (6).
When the SS model is linear, the EKF coincides with the KF,
which achieves the MMSE for linear Gaussian SS models.

An illustration of the EKF is depicted in Fig. 1. The
resulting ﬁlter admits an efﬁcient linear recursive structure.
However, it requires full knowledge of the underlying model
and notably degrades in the presence of model mismatch.
When the model is highly non-linear, the local linearity ap-
proximation may not hold, and the EKF can result in degraded
performance. This motivates the augmentation of the EKF into
the deep learning-aided KalmanNet, detailed next.
III. K ALMAN NET
Here, we present KalmanNet; a hybrid, interpretable, data
efﬁcient architecture for real-time state estimation in non-
linear dynamical systems with partial domain knowledge.
KalmanNet combines MB Kalman ﬁltering with an RNN to
cope with model mismatch and non-linearities. To introduce
KalmanNet, we begin by explaining its high level operation in
Subsection III-A. Then we present the features processed by
its internal RNN and the speciﬁc architectures considered for
implementing and training KalmanNet in Subsections III-B-
III-D. Finally, we provide a discussion in Subsection III-E.
A. High Level Architecture
We formulate KalmanNet by identifying the speciﬁc compu-
tations of the EKF that are based on unavailable knowledge.
As detailed in Subsection II-B, the functions f (·) and h (·)
are known (though perhaps inaccurately); yet the covariance
matrices Q and R are unavailable. These missing statistical
moments are used in MB Kalman ﬁltering only for computing
the KG (see Fig. 1). Thus, we design KalmanNet to learn the
KG from data, and combine the learned KG in the overall KF
ﬂow. This high level architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2.
In each time instance t ∈ T, similarly to the EKF,
KalmanNet estimates ˆxt in two steps; prediction and update.
1) The prediction step is the same as in the MB EKF, except
that only the ﬁrst-order statistical moments are predicted.
In particular, a prior estimate for the current state ˆxt|t−1
is computed from the previous posterior ˆxt−1 via (8a).
Then, a prior estimate for the current observation ˆyt|t−1
is computed from ˆxt|t−1 via (8b). As opposed to its MB
counterparts, KalmanNet does not rely on the knowledge
of noise distribution and does not maintain an explicit
estimate of the second-order statistical moments.

2) In the update step, KalmanNet uses the new observation
yt to compute the current state posterior ˆxt from the
previously computed prior ˆxt|t−1 in a similar manner to
the MB KF as in (5a), i.e., using the innovation term
∆yt computed via (7) and the KG Kt. As opposed to
the MB EKF, here the computation of the KG is not
given explicitly; rather, it is learned from data using
an RNN, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The inherent memory
of RNNs allows to implicitly track the second-order
statistical moments without requiring knowledge of the
underlying noise statistics.
Designing an RNN to learn how to compute the KG as part
of an overall KF ﬂow requires answers to three key questions:
1) From which input features (signals) will the network learn
the KG?
2) What should be the architecture of the internal RNN?
3) How will this network be trained from data?
In the following sections we address these questions.
B. Input Features
The MB KF and its variants compute the KG from knowl-
edge of the underlying statistics. To implement such compu-
tations in a learned fashion, one must provide input (features)
that capture the knowledge needed to evaluate the KG to a
neural network. The dependence of Kt on the statistics of
the observations and the state process indicates that in order
to track it, in every time step t ∈ T, the RNN should be
provided with input containing statistical information of the
observations yt and the state-estimate ˆxt−1. Therefore, the
following quantities that are related to the unknown statistical
relationship of the SS model can be used as input features to
the RNN:
F1 The observation difference ∆˜yt = yt− yt−1.
F2 The innovation difference ∆yt = yt− ˆyt|t−1 .
F3 The forward evolution difference∆˜xt = ˆxt|t− ˆxt−1|t−1 .
This quantity represents the difference between two con-
secutive posterior state estimates, where for time instance
t, the available feature is ∆˜xt−1.
F4 The forward update difference ∆ˆxt = ˆxt|t− ˆxt|t−1 , i.e.,
the difference between the posterior state estimate and
the prior state estimate, where again for time instance t
we use ∆ˆxt−1.
Features F1 and F3 encapsulate information about the state-
evolution process, while features F2 and F4 encapsulate the

uncertainty of our state estimate. The difference operation
removes the predictable components, and thus the time series
of differences is mostly affected by the noise statistics that
we wish to learn. The RNN described in Fig. 2 can use all
the features, although extensive empirical evaluation suggests
that the speciﬁc choice of combination of features depends on
the problem at hand. Our empirical observations indicate that
good combinations are {F1, F2, F4} and{F1, F3, F4}.
C. Neural Network Architecture
The internal DNN of KalmanNet uses the features discussed
in the previous section to compute the KG. It follows from
(6) that computing the KG Kt involves tracking the second-
order statistical moments Σt. The recursive nature of the KG
computation indicates that its learned module should involve
an internal memory element as an RNN to track it.
We consider two architectures for the KG computing RNN.
The ﬁrst, illustrated in Fig. 3, aims at using the internal
memory of RNNs to jointly track the underlying second-
order statistical moments required for computing the KG in an
implicit manner. To that aim, we use GRU cells [21] whose
hidden state is of the size of some integer product of m2 +n2,
which is the joint dimensionality of the tracked moments
ˆΣt|t−1 in (3b), and ˆSt in (4b). In particular, we ﬁrst use a
fully connected (FC) input layer whose output is the input
to the GRU. The GRU state vector ht is mapped into the
estimated KG Kt ∈ Rm×n using an output FC layer with
m·n neurons. While the illustration in Fig. 3 uses a single
GRU layer, one can also utilize multiple layers to increase
the capacity and abstractness of the network, as we do in the
numerical study reported in Subsection IV-E. The proposed
architecture does not directly design the hidden state of the
GRU to correspond to the unknown second-order statistical
moments that are tracked by the MB KF. As such, it uses
a relatively large number of state variables that are expected
to provide the required tracking capacity. For example, in the

Fig. 4: KalmanNet RNN block diagram (architecture #2). The
input features are used to update three GRUs with dedicated
FC layers, and the overall interconnection between the blocks
is based on the ﬂow of the KG computation in the MB KF.
numerical study in Section IV we set the dimensionality of ht
to be 10· (m2 +n2). This often results in substantial over-
parameterization, as the number of GRU parameters grows
quadratically with the number of state variables [68].
The second architecture uses separate GRU cells for each
of the tracked second-order statistical moments. The division
of the architecture into separate GRU cells and FC layers and
their interconnection is illustrated in Fig. 4. As shown in the
ﬁgure, the network composes three GRU layers, connected in
a cascade with dedicated input and output FC layers. The ﬁrst
GRU layer tracks the unknown state noise covariance Q, thus
tracking m2 variables. Similarly, the second and third GRUs
track the predicted moments ˆΣt|t−1 (3b) and ˆSt (4b), thus
having m2 and n2 hidden state variables, respectively. The
GRUs are interconnected such that the learned Q is used to
compute ˆΣt|t−1, which in turn is used to obtain ˆSt, while both
ˆΣt|t−1 and ˆSt are involved in producing Kt (6). This archi-
tecture, which is composed of a non-standard interconnection
between GRUs and FC layers, is more directly tailored towards
the formulation of the SS model and the operation of the
MB KF compared with the simpler ﬁrst architecture. As such,
it provides lesser abstraction; i.e., it is expected to be more
constrained in the family of mappings it can learn compared
with the ﬁrst architecture, while as a result also requiring
less trainable parameters. For instance, in the numerical study
reported in Subsection IV-D, utilizing the ﬁrst architecture
requires the order of 5· 105 trainable parameters, while the
second architecture utilizes merely 2.5· 104 parameters.
D. Training Algorithm
KalmanNet is trained using the available labeled data set
in a supervised manner. While we use a neural network for
computing the KG rather than for directly producing the
estimate ˆxt|t, we train KalmanNet end-to-end. Namely, we
compute the loss function L based on the state estimate ˆxt,
which is not the output of the internal RNN. Since this vector
takes values in a continuous set Rm, we use the squared-error
loss,
L =
xt− ˆxt|t
2
(10)
which is also used to evaluate the MB KF. By doing so,
we build upon the ability to backpropagate the loss to the
computation of the KG. One can obtain the loss gradient with
respect to the KG from the output of KalmanNet since
∂L
∂Kt
= ∂∥Kt∆yt− ∆xt∥2
∂Kt
= 2· (Kt· ∆yt− ∆xt)· ∆y⊤
t , (11)
where ∆xt ≜ xt− ˆxt|t−1. The gradient computation in (11)
indicates that one can learn the computation of the KG by
training KalmanNet end-to-end using the squared-error loss.
In particular, this allows to train the overall ﬁltering system
without having to externally provide ground truth values of
the KG for training purposes.
The data set used for training comprises N trajectories that
can be of varying lengths. Namely, by letting Ti be the length
of the ith training trajectory, the data set is given by D =
{(Yi, Xi)}N
1 , where
Yi =
[
y(i)
1 ,..., y(i)
Ti
]
, Xi =
[
x(i)
0 , x(i)
1 ,..., x(i)
Ti
]
. (12)
By letting Θ denote the trainable parameters of the RNN,
and γ be a regularization coefﬁcient, we then construct an ℓ2
regularized mean-squared error (MSE) loss measure
ℓi (Θ) = 1

To optimize Θ, we use a variant of mini-batch stochastic

Since KalmanNet is a recursive architecture with both
an external recurrence and an internal RNN, we use the
backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm [69] to train
it. Speciﬁcally, we unfold KalmanNet across time with shared
network parameters, and then compute a forward and back-
ward gradient estimation pass through the network. We con-
sider three different variations of applying the BPTT algorithm
for training KalmanNet:
V1 Direct application of BPTT, where for each training itera-
tion the gradients are computed over the entire trajectory.
V2 An application of the truncated BPTT algorithm [70].
Here, given a data set of long trajectories (e.g., T = 3000
time steps), each long trajectory is divided into multiple
short trajectories (e.g., T = 100 time steps), which are
shufﬂed and used during training.
V3 An alternative application of truncated BPTT, where we
6

<!-- page 7 -->

truncate each trajectory to a ﬁxed (and relatively short)
length, and train using these short trajectories.
Overall, directly applying BPTT via V1 may be computa-
tionally expensive and unstable. Therefore, a favored approach
is to ﬁrst use the truncated BPTT as in V2 as a warm-up
phase (train ﬁrst on short trajectories) in order to stabilize
its learning process, after which KalmanNet is tuned using
V1. The procedure in V3 is most suitable for systems that
are known to be likely to quickly converge to a steady state
(e.g., linear SS models). In our numerical study, reported in
Section IV, we utilize all three approaches.
E. Discussion
KalmanNet is designed to operate in a hybrid DD/MB
manner, combining deep learning with the classical EKF
procedure. By identifying the speciﬁc noise-model-dependent
computations of the EKF and replacing them with a dedicated
RNN integrated in the EKF ﬂow, KalmanNet beneﬁts from
the individual strengths of both DD and MB approaches. The
augmentation of the EKF with dedicated deep learning mod-
ules results in several core differences between KalmanNet
and its MB counterpart. Unlike the MB EKF, KalmanNet does
not attempt to linearize the SS model, and does not impose a
statistical model on the noise signals. In addition, KalmanNet
ﬁlters in a non-linear manner, as its KG matrix depends on the
input yt. Due to these differences, compared to MB Kalman
ﬁltering, KalmanNet is more robust to model mismatch and
can infer more efﬁciently, as demonstrated in Section IV. In
particular, the MB EKF is sensitive to inaccuracies in the
underlying SS model, e.g., in f (·) and h (·), while KalmanNet
can overcome such uncertainty by learning an alternative KG
that yields accurate estimation.
Furthermore, KalmanNet is derived for SS models when
noise statistics are not speciﬁed explicitly. A MB approach
to tackle this without relying on data employs the robust
Kalman ﬁlter [15]–[17], which designs the ﬁlter to minimize
the maximal MSE within some range of assumed SS models,
at the cost of performance loss, compared to knowing the true
model. When one has access to data, the direct strategy to
implement the EKF in such setups is to use the data to estimate
Q and R, either directly from the data or by backpropagating
through the operation of the EKF as in [51], and utilize these
estimates to compute the KG. As covariance estimation can
be a challenging task when dealing with high-dimensional
signals, KalmanNet bypasses this need by directly learning
the KG, and by doing so approaches the MSE of MB Kalman
ﬁltering with full knowledge of the SS model, as demonstrated
in Section IV. Finally, the computation complexity for each
time stept∈T is also linear in the RNN dimensions and does
not involve matrix inversion. This implies that KalmanNet is a
good candidate to apply for high dimensional SS models and
on computationally limited devices.
Compared to purely DD state estimation, KalmanNet ben-
eﬁts from its model awareness and the fact that its operation
follows the ﬂow of MB Kalman ﬁltering rather than being
utilized as a black box. As numerically observed in Section IV,
KalmanNet achieves improved MSE compared to utilizing
RNNs for end-to-end state estimation, and also approaches
the MMSE performance achieved by the MB KF in linear
Gaussian SS models. Furthermore, the fact that KalmanNet
preserves the ﬂow of the EKF implies that the intermediate
features exchanged between its modules have a speciﬁc oper-
ation meaning, providing interpretability that is often scarce
in end-to-end, deep learning systems. Finally, the fact that
KalmanNet learns to compute the KG indicates the possibility
of providing not only estimates of the state xt, but also a
measure of conﬁdence in this estimate, as the KG can be
related to the covariance of the estimate, as initially explored
in [71].
These combined gains of KalmanNet over purely MB
and DD approaches were recently observed in [72], which
utilized an early version of KalmanNet for real-time velocity
estimation in an autonomous racing car. In such a setup, a non-
linear, MB mixed KF was traditionally used, and suffered from
performance degradation due to inherent mismatches in the
formulation of the SS model describing the problem. Nonethe-
less, previously proposed DD techniques relying on RNNs for
end-to-end state estimation were not operable in the desired
frequencies on the hardware limited vehicle control unit. It
was shown in [72] that the application of KalmanNet allowed
to achieve improved real-time velocity tracking compared to
MB techniques while being deployed on the control unit of
the vehicle.
Our design of KalmanNet gives rise to many interesting
future extensions. Since we focus here on SS models where the
mappings f (·) and h (·) are known up to some approximation
errors, a natural extension of KalmanNet is to use the data
to pre-estimate them, as demonstrated brieﬂy in the numerical
study. Another alternative to cope with these approximation
errors is to utilize dedicated neural networks to learn these
mappings while training the entire model in an end-to-end
fashion. Doing so is expected to allow KalmanNet to be
utilized in scenarios with analytically intractable SS models, as
often arises when tracking based on unstructured observations,
e.g., visual observations as in [56].
While we train KalmanNet in a supervised manner using
labeled data, the fact that it preserves the operation of the
MB EKF that produces a prediction of the next observation
ˆyt|t−1 for each time instance indicates the possibility of using
this intermediate feature for unsupervised training. One can
thus envision KalmanNet being trained ofﬂine in a supervised
manner, while tracking variations in the underlying SS model
at run-time by online self supervision, following a similar
rationale to that used in [24], [25] for deep symbol detection
in time-varying communication channels.
Finally, we note that while we focus here on ﬁltering
tasks, SS models are used to represent additional related
problems such as smoothing and prediction, as discussed in
Subsection II-A. The fact that KalmanNet does not explicitly
estimate the SS model implies that it cannot simply substitute
these parameters into an alternative algorithm capable of
carrying out tasks other than ﬁltering. Nonetheless, one can
still design DNN-aided algorithms for these tasks operating
with partially known SS models as extensions of KalmanNet,
in the same manner as many MB algorithms build upon the
7

<!-- page 8 -->

KF. For instance, as the MB KF constitutes the ﬁrst part of the
Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother [73], one can extend Kalman-
Net to implement high-performance smoothing in partially
known SS models, as we have recently began investigating
in [67]. Nonetheless, we leave the exploration of extensions
of KalmanNet to alternative tasks associated with SS models
for future work.
IV. E XPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
In this section we present an extensive numerical study of
KalmanNet1, evaluating its performance in multiple setups and
comparing it to various benchmark algorithms:
(a) In our ﬁrst experimental study, we consider multiple
linear SS models, and compare KalmanNet to the MB
KF which is known to minimize the MSE in such a setup.
We also conﬁrm our design and architectural choices by
comparing KalmanNet with alternative RNN based end-
to-end state estimators.
(b) We next consider two non-linear SS models, a sinusoidal
model, and the chaotic Lorenz attractor. We compare
KalmanNet with the common non-linear MB bench-
marks; namely, the EKF, UKF, and PF.
(c) In our last study we consider a localization use case based
on the Michigan NCLT data set [28]. Here, we compare
KalmanNet with MB KF that assumes a linear Wiener
kinematic model [36] and with a vanilla RNN based
end-to-end state estimator, and demonstrate the ability
of KalmanNet to track real world dynamics that was not
synthetically generated from an underlying SS model.
A. Experimental Setting
Throughout the numerical study and unless stated otherwise,
in the experiments involving synthetic data, the SS model is
generated using diagonal noise covariance matrices; i.e.,
Q = q2· I, R = r2· I, ν ≜ q2
r2. (15)
By (15), setting ν to be 0 dB implies that both the state
noise and the observation noise have the same variance.
For consistency, we use the term full information for cases
where the SS model available to KalmanNet and its MB
counterparts accurately represents the underlying dynamics.
More speciﬁcally, KalmanNet operates with full knowledge
of f (·) and h (·), and without access to the noise covariance
matrices, while its MB counterparts operate with an accurate
knowledge of Q and R. The term partial information refers
to the case where KalmanNet and its MB counterparts operate
with some level of model mismatch, where the SS model
design parameters do not represent the underlying dynamics
accurately (i.e., are not equal to the SS parameters from
which the data was generated). Unless stated otherwise, the
metric used to evaluate the performance is the MSE on a [dB]
scale. In the ﬁgures we depict the MSE in [dB] versus the
inverse observation noise level, i.e., 1
r2 , also on a [dB] scale.
1The source code used in our numerical study along with the complete set
of hyperparameters used in each numerical evaluation can be found online at
https://github.com/KalmanNet/KalmanNet TSP.
In some of our experiments, we evaluate both the MSE and
its standard deviation, where we denote these measures by ˆµ
and ˆσ, respectively.
1) KalmanNet Setting: In Section III we present several
architectures and training mechanisms that can be used when
implementing KalmanNet. In our experimental study we con-
sider three different conﬁgurations of KalmanNet:
C1 KalmanNet architecture #1 with input features {F2, F4}
and with training algorithm V3.
C2 KalmanNet architecture #1 with input features {F2, F4}
and with training algorithm V1.
C3 KalmanNet architecture #1 with input features {F1, F3,
F4} and with training algorithm V2.
C4 KalmanNet architecture #2 with all input features and
with training algorithm V1.
In all our experiments KalmanNet was trained using the Adam
optimizer [74].
2) Model-Based Filters: In the following experimental
study we compare KalmanNet with several MB ﬁlters. For
the UKF we used the software package [75], while the PF
is implemented based on [76] using 100 particles and with-
out parallelization. During our numerical study, when model
uncertainty was introduced, we optimized the performance of
the MB algorithms by carefully tuning the covariance matrices,
usually via a grid search. For long trajectories (e.g.,T >1500)
it was sometimes necessary to tune these matrices, even in
the case of full information, to compensate for inaccurate
uncertainty propagation due to non-linear approximations and
to avoid divergence.
B. Linear State Space Model
Our ﬁrst experimental study compares KalmanNet to the
MB KF for different forms of synthetically generated linear
system dynamics. Unless stated otherwise, here F takes the
controllable canonical form.
1) Full Information: We start by comparing KalmanNet of
setting C1 to the MB KF for the case of full information,
where the latter is known to minimize the MSE. Here, we
set H to take the inverse canonical form, and ν = 0 [dB]. To
demonstrate the applicability of KalmanNet to various linear
systems, we experimented with systems of different dimen-
sions; namely, m×n∈{ 2× 2, 5× 5, 10× 1}, and with tra-
jectories of different lengths; namely,T∈{ 50, 100, 150, 200}.
In Fig. 5a we can clearly observe that KalmanNet achieves the
MMSE of the MB KF. Moreover, to further evaluate the gains
of the hybrid architecture of KalmanNet, we check that its
learning is transferable. Namely, in some of the experiments,
we test KalmanNet on longer trajectories then those it was
trained on, and with different initial conditions. The fact that
KalmanNet achieves the MMSE lower bound also for these
cases indicates that it indeed learns to implement Kalman
ﬁltering, and it is not tailored to the trajectories presented
during training, with dependency only on the SS model.
2) Neural Model Selection: Next, we evaluate and conﬁrm
our design and architectural choices by considering a 2× 2

setup (similar to the previous one), and by comparing Kalman-
Net with setting C1 to two RNN based architectures of similar
capacity applied for end-to-end state estimation:
• Vanilla RNN directly maps the observed yt to an estimate
of the state ˆxt.
• MB RNN imitates the Kalman ﬁltering operation by ﬁrst
recovering ˆxt|t−1 using domain knowledge, i.e., via (3a),
and then uses the RNN to estimate an increment ∆ˆxt
from the prior to posterior.
All RNNs utilize the same architecture as in KalmanNet with
a single GRU layer and the same learning hyperparameters. In
this experiment we test the trained models on trajectories with
the same length as they were trained on, namely T = 20. We
can clearly observe how each of the key design considerations
of KalmanNet affect the learning curves depicted in Fig. 5b:
• The incorporation of the known SS model allows the
MB RNN to outperform the vanilla RNN, although both
converge slowly and fail to achieve the MMSE.
• Using the sequences of differences as input notably
improves the convergence rate of the MB RNN, indi-
cating the beneﬁts of using the differences as features, as
discussed in Subsection III-B.
• Learning is further improved by using the RNN for
recovering the KG as part of the KF ﬂow, as done by
KalmanNet, rather than for directly estimating xt.
To further evaluate the gains of KalmanNet over end-to-end
RNNs, we compare the pre-trained models using trajectories
with different initial conditions and a longer time horizon
(T = 200) than the one on which they were trained ( T = 20).
The results, summarized in Table I, show that KalmanNet
maintains achieving the MMSE, as already observed in Fig. 5a.
The MB RNN and vanilla RNN are more than 50 [dB] from
the MMSE, implying that their learning is not transferable and
that they do not learn to implement Kalman ﬁltering. However,
when provided with the difference features as we proposed in
Subsection III-B, the DD systems are shown to be applicable
in longer trajectories, with KalmanNet achieving MSE within
a minor gap of that achieved by the MB KF. The results of this
study validate the considerations used in designing KalmanNet
for the DD ﬁltering problem discussed in Subsection II-B.

3) Partial Information: To conclude our study on linear
models, we next evaluate the robustness of KalmanNet to
model mismatch as a result of partial model information. We
simulate a 2×2 SS model with mismatches in either the state-
evolution model (F) or in the state-observation model ( H).
State-Evolution Mismatch: Here, we set T = 20 and ν =
0 [dB] and use a rotated evolution matrix Fα◦,α∈{ 10◦, 20◦}
for data generation. The state-evolution matrix available to
the ﬁlters, denoted F0, is again set to take the controllable
canonical form. The mismatched design matrix F0 is related
to true Fα◦ via
Fα◦ = Rxy
α◦· F0, Rxy
α◦ =
(
cosα − sinα
sinα cosα
)
. (16)
Such scenarios represent a setup in which the analytical
approximation of the SS model differs from the true generative
model. The resulting MSE curves depicted in Fig. 6a demon-
strate that KalmanNet (with setting C2) achieves a 3 [dB] gain
over the MB KF. In particular, despite the fact that KalmanNet
implements the KF with an inaccurate state-evolution model,
it learns to apply an alternative KG, resulting in MSE within
a minor gap from the MMSE; i.e., from the KF with the true
Fα◦ plugged in.
State-Observation Mismatch: Next, we simulate a setup
with state-observation mismatch while setting T = 100 and
ν =−20 [dB]. The model mismatch is achieved by using a
rotated observation matrix Hα=10◦ for data generation, while
using H = I as the observation design matrix. Such scenarios
represent a setup in which a slight misalignment (≈ 5%) of the
sensors exists. The resulting achieved MSE depicted in Fig. 6b
demonstrates that KalmanNet (with setting C2) converges to
within a minor gap from the MMSE. Here, we performed an
additional experiment, ﬁrst estimating the observation matrix
from data, and then KalmanNet used the estimate matrix
denoted ˆHα. In this case it is observed in Fig. 6b that
KalmanNet achieves the MMSE lower bound. These results
imply that KalmanNet converges also in distribution to the

KF.
C. Synthetic Non-Linear Model
Next, we consider a non-linear SS model, where the state-
evolution model takes a sinusoidal form, while the state-
observation model is a second order polynomial. The resulting
SS model is given by
f (x) =α· sin (β· x +φ) +δ, x∈ R2, (17a)
h (x) =a· (b· x +c)2, y∈ R2. (17b)
In the following we generate trajectories ofT = 100 time steps
from the noisy SS model in (1), with ν =−20 [dB], while
using f (·) and h (·) as in (17) computed in a component-wise
manner, with parameters as in Table II. KalmanNet is used
with setting C4.
The MSE values for different levels of observation noise
achieved by KalmanNet compared with the MB EKF are
depicted in Fig. 7 for both full and partial model information.
The full evaluation with the MB EKF, UKF, and PF is given
in Table III for the case of full information, and in Table IV for
the case of partial information. We ﬁrst observe that the EKF
achieves the lowest MSE values among the MB ﬁlters, there-
fore serving as our main MB benchmark in our experimental
studies. For full information and in the low noise regime, EKF
achieves the lowest MSE values due to its ability to approach
the MMSE in such setups, and KalmanNet achieves similar
performance. For higher noise levels; i.e., for 1
r2 =−12.04
[dB], the MB EKF suffers from degraded performance due
to a non-linear effect. Nonetheless, by learning to compute
the KG from data, KalmanNet manages to overcome this and
achieves superior MSE.
In the presence of partial model information, the state-
evolution parameters used by the ﬁlters differs slightly from
the true model, resulting in a notable degradation in the
performance of the MB ﬁlters due to the model mismatch.
In all experiments, KalmanNet overcomes such mismatches,
and its performance is within a small gap of that achieved
when using full information for such setups. We thus conclude
that in the presence of harsh non-linearities as well as model
uncertainty due to inaccurate approximation of the underlying
dynamics, where MB variations of the KF fail, KalmanNet
learns to approach the MMSE while maintaining the real-time
operation and low complexity of the KF.
D. Lorenz Attractor
The Lorenz attractor is a three-dimensional chaotic so-
lution to the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equa-
tions in continuous-time. This synthetically generated system
demonstrates the task of online tracking a highly non-linear
trajectory and a real world practical challenge of handling
mismatches due to sampling a continuous-time signal into
discrete-time [77].

In particular, the noiseless state-evolution of the continuous-
time process xτ with τ∈ R+ is given by



To get a discrete-time, state-evolution model, we repeat the
steps used in [35]. First, we sample the noiseless process with
sampling interval ∆τ and assume that A (xτ) can be kept
constant in a small neighborhood of xτ ; i.e.,
A (xτ)≈ A (xτ+∆τ).
Then, the continuous-time solution of the differential system
(18), which is valid in the neighborhood of xτ for a short time
interval ∆τ, is
xτ+∆τ = exp (A (xτ)· ∆τ)· xτ. (19)
Finally, we take the Taylor series expansion of (19) and a ﬁnite
series approximation (with J coefﬁcients), which results in
F (xτ) ≜ exp (A (xτ)· ∆τ)≈ I+

The resulting discrete-time evolution process is given by

The discrete-time state-evolution model in (21), with addi-
tional process noise, is used for generating the simulated
Lorenz attractor data. Unless stated otherwise the data was
generated with J = 5 Taylor order and ∆τ = 0.02 sampling
interval. In the following experiments, KalmanNet is consis-
tently invariant of the distribution of the noise signals, with the
models it uses for f (·) and h (·) varying between the different
studies, as discussed in the sequel.
1) Full Information: We ﬁrst compare KalmanNet to the
MB ﬁlter when using the state-evolution matrix F computed
via (20) with J = 5.

Noisy state observations : Here, we set h (·) to be the
identity transformation, such that the observations are noisy
versions of the true state. Further, we set ν =−20 [dB] and
T = 2000 . As observed in Fig. 8a, despite being trained
on short trajectories T = 100, KalmanNet (with setting C3)
achieves excellent MSE performance—namely, comparable to
EKF—and outperforms the UKF and PF. The full details of
the experiment are given in Table V. All the MB algorithms
were optimized for performance; e.g., applying the EKF with
full model information achieves an unstable state tracking
performance, with MSE values surpassing 30 [dB]. To stabilize
the EKF, we had to perform a grid search using the available
data set to optimize the process noise Q used by the ﬁlter.
Noisy non-linear observations: Next, we consider the case
where the observations are given by a non-linear function of
the current state, setting h to take the form of a transformation
from a cartesian coordinate system to spherical coordinates.
We further set T = 20 and ν = 0 [ dB]. From the results
depicted in Fig. 8b and reported in Table VI we observe that

in such non-linear setups, the sub-optimal MB approaches op-
erating with full information of the SS model are substantially
outperformed by KalmanNet (with setting C4).
2) Partial Information: W proceed to evaluate KalmanNet
and compare it to its MB counterparts under partial model
information. We consider three possible sources of model
mismatch arising in the Lorenz attractor setup:
• State-evolution mismatch due to use of a Taylor series
approximation of insufﬁcient order.
• State-observation mismatch as a result of misalignment
due to rotation.
• State-observation mismatch as a result of sampling from
continuous-time to discrete-time.
Since the EKF produced the best results in the full information
case among all non-linear MB ﬁltering algorithms, we use it
as a baseline for the MSE lower bound.
State-evolution mismatch : In this study, both KalmanNet
and the MB algorithms operate with a crude approximation
of the evolution dynamics obtained by computing (20) with
J = 2, while the data is generated with an order J = 5 Taylor
series expansion. We again set h to be the identity mapping,
T = 2000, and ν =−20 [dB]. The results, depicted in Fig. 9a
and reported in Table VII, demonstrate that KalmanNet (with
setting C4) learns to partially overcome this model mismatch,
outperforming its MB counterparts operating with the same
level of partial information.
State-observation rotation mismatch : Here, the presence
of mismatch in the observations model is simulated by using
data generated by an identity matrix rotated by merely θ = 1◦.
This rotation is equivalent to sensor misalignment of≈ 0.55%.
The results depicted in Figure. 9b and reported in Table VIII
clearly demonstrate that this seemingly minor rotation can

cause a severe performance degradation for the MB ﬁlters,
while KalmanNet (with setting C3) is able to learn from data to
overcome such mismatches and to notably outperform its MB
counterparts, which are sensitive to model uncertainty. Here,
we trained KalmanNet on short trajectories with T = 100
time steps, tested it on longer trajectories with T = 1000 time
steps, and set ν =−20 [dB]. This again demonstrates that the
learning of KalmanNet is transferable.
State-observations sampling mismatch : We conclude our
experimental study of the Lorenz attractor setup with an eval-
uation of KalmanNet in the presence of sampling mismatch.
Here, we generate data from the Lorenz attractor SS model
with an approximate continuous-time evolution process using
a dense sampling rate, set to ∆τ = 10−5. We then sub-sample
the noiseless observations from the evolution process by a ratio

2000 and get a decimated process with ∆τd = 0.02. This
procedure results in an inherent mismatch in the SS model due
to representing an (approximately) continuous-time process
using a discrete-time sequence. In this experiment, no process
noise was applied, and the observations are again obtained
with h set to identity and T = 3000.
The resulting MSE values for 1
r2 = 0 [dB] of KalmanNet
with conﬁguration C4 compared with the MB ﬁlters and with
the end-to-end neural network termed MB-RNN (see Subsec-
tion IV-B) are reported in Table IX. The results demonstrate
that KalmanNet overcomes the mismatch induced by repre-
senting a continuous-time SS model in discrete-time, achieving
a substantial processing gain over the MB alternatives due
to its learning capabilities. The results also demonstrate that
KalmanNet signiﬁcantly outperforms a straightforward com-
bination of domain knowledge; i.e. a state-transition function
f (·), with end-to-end RNNs. A fully model-agnostic RNN
was shown to diverge when trained for this task. In Fig. 10
we visualize how this gain is translated into clearly improved
tracking of a single trajectory. To show that these gains of
KalmanNet do not come at the cost of computationally slow
inference, we detail the average inference time for all ﬁlters
(without parallelism). The stopwatch timings were measured
on the same platform – Google Colab with CPU: Intel(R)
Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.20GHz, GPU: Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB. We
see that KalmanNet infers faster than the classical methods,
thanks to the highly efﬁcient neural network computations
and the fact that, unlike the MB ﬁlters, it does not involve
linearization and matrix inversions for each time step.
E. Real World Dynamics: Michigan NCLT Data Set
In our ﬁnal experiment we evaluate KalmanNet on the
Michigan NCLT data set [28]. This data set comprises different
labeled trajectories, with each one containing noisy sensor

readings (e.g., GPS and odometer) and the ground truth loca-
tions of a moving Segway robot. Given these noisy readings,
the goal of the tracking algorithm is to localize the Segway
from the raw measurements at any given time.
To tackle this problem we model the Segway kinematics (in
each axis separately) using the linear Wiener velocity model,
where the acceleration is modeled as a white Gaussian noise
process wτ with variance q2 [36]:
xτ = (p,v )⊤∈ R2, ∂
∂τ xτ =
(
0 1
0 0
)
· xτ +
(
0
wτ
)
. (22)
Here, p and v are the position and velocity, respectively.
The discrete-time state-evolution with sampling interval ∆τ
is approximated as a linear SS model in which the evolution
matrix F and noise covariance Q are given by
F =
(1 ∆ τ
0 1
)
, Q = q2·
(1
3· (∆τ)3 1
2· (∆τ)2
1
2· (∆τ)2 ∆τ
)
. (23)
Since KalmanNet does not rely on knowledge of the noise
covariance matrices, Q is given here for the use of the MB
KF and for completeness.
The goal is to track the underlying state vector in both axes
solely using odometry data; i.e., the observations are given by
noisy velocity readings. In this case the observations obey a
noisy linear model:
y∈ R, H = (0, 1). (24)
Such settings where one does not have access to direct
measurements for positioning are very challenging yet prac-
tical and typical for many applications where positioning
technologies are not available indoors, and one must rely on
noisy odometer readings for self-localization. Odometry-based
estimated positions typically start drifting away at some point.
In the assumed model, the x-axis (in cartesian coordinates)
are decoupled from the y-axis, and the linear SS model used

∈ R2×2. (25b)
This model is equivalent to applying two independent KFs
in parallel. Unlike the MB KF, KalmanNet does not rely on
noise modeling, and can thus accommodate dependency in its
learned KG.
We arbitrarily use the session with date 2012-01-22 that
consists of a single trajectory. Sampling at 1[Hz] results in
5, 850 time steps. We removed unstable readings and were
left with 5,556 time steps. The trajectory was split into three
sections: 85% for training ( 23 sequences of length T = 200),
10% for validation (2 sequences,T = 200), and 5% for testing
(1 sequence, T = 277). We compare KalmanNet with setting
C1 to end-to-end vanilla RNN and the MB KF, where for the
latter the matrices Q and R were optimized through a grid
search.
Fig. 11 and Table X demonstrate the superiority of Kalman-
Net for such scenarios. KF blindly follows the odometer tra-
jectory and is incapable of accounting for the drift, producing
a very similar or even worse estimation than the integrated
velocity. The vanilla RNN, which is agnostic of the motion
model, fails to localize. KalmanNet overcomes the errors
induced by the noisy odometer observations, and provides
the most accurate real-time locations, demonstrating the gains
of combining MB KF-based inference with integrated DD
modules for real world applications.
V. C ONCLUSIONS
In this work we presented KalmanNet, a hybrid combination
of deep learning with the classic MB EKF. Our design iden-
tiﬁes the SS-model-dependent computations of the MB EKF,
replacing them with a dedicated RNN operating on speciﬁc

features encapsulating the information needed for its operation.
Our numerical study shows that doing so enables KalmanNet
to carry out real-time state estimation in the same manner
as MB Kalman ﬁltering, while learning to overcome model
mismatches and non-linearities. KalmanNet uses a relatively
compact RNN that can be trained with a relatively small
data set and infers a reduced complexity, making it applicable
for high dimensional SS models and computationally limited
devices.
