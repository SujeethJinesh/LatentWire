FOR COMPACT STORAGE IN LLM I NFERENCE

ABSTRACT
Serving large language models (LLMs) at scale necessitates efficient key-value
(KV) cache management. KV caches can be reused across conversation turns via
shared-prefix prompts that are common in iterative code editing and chat. How-
ever, stale caches consume scarce GPU memory, require offloading, or force re-
computation. We present kvtc, a lightweight transform coder that compresses
KV caches for compact on-GPU and off-GPU storage. Drawing on classical
media compression, kvtc combines PCA-based feature decorrelation, adaptive
quantization, and entropy coding. It requires only a brief initial calibration and
leaves model parameters unchanged. By exploiting redundancies in KV caches,
kvtc achieves up to 20 × compression while maintaining reasoning and long-
context accuracy, and 40 × or higher for specific use cases. We test kvtc with
Llama 3, Mistral NeMo, and R1-Qwen 2.5 models across benchmarks including
AIME25, GSM8K, LiveCodeBench, LongBench, MATH-500, MMLU, Qasper
and RULER. It consistently outperforms inference-time baselines such as token
eviction, quantization, and SVD-based methods, while achieving higher compres-
sion ratios. These results supportkvtc as a practical building block for memory-
efficient LLM serving with reusable KV caches.

Chat-based interfaces, commonly used for inter-
acting with large language models (LLMs), enable
users to iteratively refine answers across open-
domain dialogues and specialized tasks, such as
code generation (Chiang et al., 2024; K ¨opf et al.,
2023). Each conversational turn extends the key–
value (KV) cache associated with a conversation,
storing hidden activations for every previous to-
ken. For modern Transformer models, this cache
can easily occupy multiple gigabytes. As mod-
els scale up in size and reasoning capability, gen-
erating increasingly long reasoning chains (Ope-
nAI et al., 2024), the KV cache footprint increases,
posing a significant bottleneck for throughput and
latency. During user turns, stale KV caches left on-
chip occupy memory, which is needed for serving
other users, yet ensure the fastest responses in the
future. Conversely, caches could be discarded, in-
curring the cost of recomputation, or offloaded to
CPU DRAM or local/network storage, leading to
transfer overheads. This tension creates a latency–
throughput dilemma in production systems and ne-
cessitates careful configuration.
Crucially, inference frameworks view the local KV
caches as databases. Strategies such as block-level

Cosine Similarity (b) Values
Figure 3: Cosine similarity before and after alignment between key (a) and value (b) heads calculated
using Llama 3.1 8B on inputs from Qasper (Dasigi et al., 2021; Shaham et al., 2022). For each
example, we calculate cosine similarity between all keys/values from the same position and then
average across the batch. Orthonormal alignment matrices were produced using 20 samples from
the RedPajama v2 (Weber et al., 2024).
paging and prefix sharing promote reuse of caches whenever prompt prefix matches (Kwon et al.,
2023). Scaling LLM serving increasingly hinges on KV cache management and reuse (Liu et al.,
2024b; Cheng et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2025), but current systems struggle to store, move, and refresh
these caches efficiently. CacheGen (Liu et al., 2024b) compresses caches for transmission, offering
at most 8.6× KV cache reduction in comparison to a 16-bit baseline. SVDq (Yankun et al., 2025) and
xKV (Chang et al., 2025) pursue low-rank compression during prefill, but both require calculation of
per-prompt SVD. Long and frequently used prompts may justify investing more compute for offline
training of corpus-specific caches (Eyuboglu et al., 2025).
Meanwhile, intensively studied KV cache compression methods, aimed at improving the runtime
efficiency of autoregressive generation, offer interim measures to the cache retention problem (Yuan
et al., 2024). Prior work hinges on observations that KV cache can be quantized (Frantar et al.,
2023) sparsified (Liu et al., 2024d; Hooper et al., 2024), average-pooled (Nawrot et al., 2024), or
shared between layers (Brandon et al., 2024); the cache itself is compressible (Yuan et al., 2024), and
dimensions of keys and values for separate heads show a high degree of correlation (Zhang et al.,
2023). For long contexts, these methods offer substantial throughput and latency improvements, by
lowering KV cache sizes and thus the memory traffic during next token prediction. However, due to
tight latency constraints, often coupled with refraining from modifying weights of the model, these
techniques tend to be brittle (Tang et al., 2024), and accuracy degradation prohibits combining meth-
ods for compounded benefits. Finally, these methods seldom exploit the strong low-rank structure
of KV tensors.
In this paper, we introducekvtc: a simple yet powerful transform coding scheme, compressing KV
caches for storage. Inspired by classical image codecs, it applies a learned orthonormal transform
followed by channel-wise scalar quantization, which dynamically allocates bits, and entropy coding.
The resulting bitstream is on average 20 × smaller than the original 16-bit one, while maintaining
comparable accuracy. The method also exposes a smooth compression–accuracy trade-off, with
40× or higher compression attainable at modest accuracy decrease. Thus, kvtc largely mitigates
the problem of KV cache management: lowering the cost of its on-chip retention and the bandwidth
required for offloading, without compromising interactive latency.

fixed. Additional ablations are provided in Appendices B.3 and B.7.
Motivated by work on cross-layer KV cache sharing and compression (Brandon et al., 2024; Chang
et al., 2025), we ask whether keys from different attention heads, and analogously values, lie in a
shared latent space. To be more precise, we examine if it is possible to align key or value caches,
produced by different attention heads, via linear transformations. Specifically, for each pair of atten-
tion heads hi, hj in the model, we attempt to align their cachesKi, Kj ∈ Rt×dhead with an orthogonal
map found by solving the Procrustes problem (Gower & Dijksterhuis, 2004):
R⋆ = arg minR ∥Ki − KjR∥F s.t. R⊤R = I. (1)
We then compute token-wise cosine similarity between Ki and Kj before alignment, and between
Ki and KjR⋆ after alignment. We repeat the same procedure for values using Vi, Vj. Before
alignment, inter-head cosine similarity is typically below 0.2. After orthogonal alignment, similarity
increases substantially for keys and moderately for values (Figure 3). This pattern suggests that key
heads largely inhabit a common subspace up to an orthogonal transformation; their dissimilarity
before alignment likely stems from random initialization of key and value projection matrices. We
note that for a data matrix A ∈ Rn×d, if k directions suffice to explain all of the variance ofA, then
k directions suffice to explain all of the variance of B = [ A, AR] ∈ Rn×(d+d′), for R ∈ Rd×d′
.
This motivates our choice of PCA as a dimensionality reduction method.
Another motivation comes from the work on efficient attention kernels (Jiang et al., 2024). To be
more precise, from the observation that different attention heads can show similar attention patterns.
In a simplified setting without RoPE (Su et al., 2024), where keys are equal to queries and we assume
the exact equality of dot products that create the attention patterns, the key spaces are equal up to an
orthogonal transform by the uniqueness of Gram realizations (Horn & Johnson, 2013).
Sliding Windows and Sink Tokens We avoid compressing both the w most recent tokens and s
oldest tokens (attention sinks) due to their disproportionately high contribution to typical attention
patterns (Jiang et al., 2024). In transform coding for vision and audio, bits are allocated to transform
coefficients so that quantization induces minimal perceptual distortion. By loose analogy, the atten-
tion mass allocated to a token can be viewed as a proxy for its importance. In addition, when PCA is
used to reduce the dimensionality of keys and values, the initial tokens yield higher reconstruction
errors, as shown in Figure 6.
Foreshadowing the experiments described in Section 4, we have chosen w = 128 and s = 4 for
evaluation. To illustrate their influence on accuracy, we ablate on their compression by setting either
w = 0 or s = 0, as shown in Figure 4. These experiments show that compressing these tokens can
significantly lower, or even entirely collapse the accuracy at high compression ratios.
Multi-Turn Conversations Let a conversation be an ordered sequence
C = ((x0, y 0), (x1, y 1), . . .),
where xt denotes the user (or system) input at turn t and yt the generated reply. Generation of yt
consists of a prefill pass, which produces the KV cache for all preceding tokens (x0, y0, . . . , xt),
followed by iterative decoding, which generates the tokens of yt one at a time.

When a new user prompt xi is received, the existing KV cache can be re-used and only newly
added tokens have to be forwarded through the model, reducing computation and time-to-first-token
(TTFT). However, if the cache has been deleted, the model must reprocess the entire conversation
as a prompt, resulting in quadratic recomputation of attention across the input.

KV Cache Management while Serving Efficient
LLM deployments often split prefill and decode
across separate nodes due to their distinct perfor-
mance profiles (Zhong et al., 2024), as shown in Fig-
ure 5. The prefill node produces the KV cache and
transmits it to the decode node over a high-speed
fabric, typically RDMA-capable such as InfiniBand
or RoCE, minimizing latency and CPU overhead
on the host. Both nodes may maintain tiered KV
caches: GPU HBM (hot), CPU DRAM (warm), and
NVMe/SSD (cold), managed with a retention policy.
Long-term storage might require sending caches to a
remote location. Crucially, the decision to select a node for either prefill or decode of a certain input
can be dictated by the already-held KV cache with a matching prefix. In such setups, KV cache
transfers are typically the dominant cross-node traffic.
Why compress KV caches after the prefill or decode phase? Compression can: (i) extend the effec-
tive capacity of a KV cache database, and thus the lifetimes of caches, roughly in proportion to the
compression ratio, and (ii) reduce network traffic. We discuss both angles below.
(i) Extending KV cache lifetimes increases cache hit rates in higher tiers (HBM/DRAM), often
avoiding or substantially reducing prefill time for prompts with long, recently processed pre-
fixes. For example, during a session with a coding assistant, a single 1,000-line file tokenized
at ∼ 10 tokens per line and processed by Llama 3.3 70B yields about 1.6 GiB of 8-bit KV
cache. Subsequent conversation turns, or a few parallel conversations about this file, might
reuse the corresponding cache. However, on a node which serves multiple clients, the volume
of generated KV cache might shorten its hot/warm residency even at moderate batch sizes.
A 20 × lifetime extension via compression might determine whether a KV cache remains
hot/warm until it becomes useful, or needs to be recomputed from scratch.
(ii) Prefill time scales as O(n2) with prompt length and typically dominates transfer time. In
addition, KV caches can be streamed by layer during prefill in order to further reduce TTFT
(Qin et al., 2025). However, KV cache compression reduces memory traffic proportionally to
the compression ratio, which might be critical when the network bandwidth is saturated and
becomes the bottleneck.

Our Key-Value Transform Coder ( kvtc), shown in Figure 1, builds upon the transform-coding
framework (Ahmed et al., 1974; Goyal, 2001), a widely adopted methodology for designing image
and video compression algorithms such as JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group JPEG, 1994).
It applies feature decorrelation by projecting onto an orthonormal basis matrix V obtained via the
singular value decomposition (SVD) of centered calibration data (i.e., principal component analy-
sis, PCA). Quantization parameters are selected using a dynamic programming algorithm, and the
resulting symbols are entropy-coded with DEFLATE (Wu, 2017). The three modes of operation of
kvtc are:
• Calibration This step is performed only once for every model and compression ratio. During
calibration, we obtain the key and value caches for the calibration dataset, calculateSVD(C−µ) =
UΣV ⊤ where µ is the mean of the data, and store the projection matrices V ⊤ (for key and value
caches separately). Next, we run a dynamic programming algorithm that produces the optimal bit
allocation for each of the principal components. This step is fast; for instance, calibration for a
12B model can be completed within 10 minutes on an H100 GPU (Appendix B.5). In Appendix
B.14 we show that the additional amount of data stored per model is relatively small ( 2.4% of
model parameters for Llama 3.3 70B). In Appendix B.10 we perform an ablation study on the
number of layers over which we concatenate the KV caches.
• Compression Keys and values are compressed independently using the(V, µ) parameters and bit
allocation obtained during calibration. Compression is performed between inference phases (e.g.,
after decoding or between prefill and decoding) and can be executed on either GPU (affecting
TTFT) or CPU (if the cache is already in storage). Importantly, during decoding, the model
operates on decompressed KV caches; compression is used only for storage or transfer.
• Decompression Decompression reverses the compression steps. The most computationally in-
tensive operation—the inverse projection using V ⊤—can be performed layer-by-layer using sub-
matrices of V ⊤, allowing generation to begin early.
In the following sections we describe in detail the components of kvtc during calibration, com-
pression and decompression.
3.1 F EATURE DECORRELATION
Unlike prior SVD-based methods that calculate a separate decomposition for each prompt (Yankun
et al., 2025; Chang et al., 2025), we compute the KV cache projection matricesonce using a calibra-
tion dataset C, and reuse them across all requests at inference time. Preparing a single, generalizable
V rests on three observations. First, SVD must be computed on a large, representative sample; sam-
pling token positions from a diverse calibration set suffices for generalization and is computationally
tractable. Second, excluding keys and values corresponding to the most recent tokens and attention
sinks improves the achievable compression ratio (see Tables 6 and 13 in Appendix B). Third, po-
sitional embeddings distort the apparent low-rank structure of keys and should be removed before
compression (Sun et al., 2025).
During calibration, we forward all sequences fromC through the model and collect their KV caches.
For each sequence, cache entries are concatenated along the time dimension to form a global pool
of positions. We then sample n token positions from this pool, excluding attention sinks. For each
sampled position, we take the corresponding keys (and, equivalently, values) from l layers and h
heads, undo positional rotations, and concatenate them along the hidden dimension dhead. This
yields a data matrix C ∈ Rn×p with p = l h dhead, whose rows index sampled token positions. Let
µ ∈ Rp be the per-feature mean of C. We compute the SVD of the centered matrix,
C − µ = U Σ V ⊤, (2)
with singular values on diag(Σ) sorted in descending order (equivalently, PCA of C). For any
X ∈ Rm×p, the decorrelated representation and its inverse are
D = (X − µ) V, X = D V ⊤ + µ, (3)
where the equality holds when all p components are used. When r < p and the basis is truncated
to V ∈ Rp×r, then X ≈ D V ⊤ + µ. For scalability, we use randomized SVD (Halko et al., 2011)
calculated on a GPU with target rank r < p , substantially reducing runtime and memory. Results
for this variant are shown in Figure 6, with additional details and ablations in Appendix B.1.

3.2 Q UANTIZATION
PCA orders principal components by explained variance. We exploit this ordering to allocate a
fixed bit budget across PCA coordinates so that high-variance components receive more bits. The
allocation is computed once on a calibration set and reused at inference. We quantizeD coordinate-
wise to obtain Dq1,...,qd, where qi ∈ Z≥0 is the bit width assigned to the i-th principal component.
Under a global bit budget, we minimize the Frobenius reconstruction error


DV ⊤ − Dq1,...,qk V ⊤

2
F . (4)
Because right-multiplication by an orthonormal matrix preserves the Frobenius norm, we have


DV ⊤ − Dq1,...,qk V ⊤

2
F =


(D − Dq1,...,qk)V ⊤

2
F = ∥D − Dq1,...,qk ∥2
F . (5)
Thus, optimal bit allocation can be found directly in the decorrelated domain.
We solve the constrained allocation with a simple dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that keeps
two tables: (1) the minimum reconstruction error achievable using the first i principal components
under a payload of b bits; and (2) a backpointer storing the optimal local decision. Pseudocode and
a proof sketch of optimality under these constraints are in Appendix B.17. Furthermore, inspired
by the Microscaling data formats (Rouhani et al., 2023), we quantize groups of subsequent PCA
coordinates together, each group with shared 16-bit shift and scaling factors. The DP optimizes
both the per-group bit width and group size, restricted to {1, 16, 64, 256, 1024} components per
group. The total budget equals the sum of payload bits across all coordinates plus per-group shift
and scaling factors.
An example allocation is shown in Figure 6. As expected, the learned bit widths decrease mono-
tonically for subsequent principal components. Crucially, the DP assigns zero bits to a substantial
number of trailing principal components. This observation motivates reducing the dimensionality
early during the calculation of PCA, lowering the cost of calibration, and trimming V to the dimen-
sions with nonzero bit widths for faster compression/decompression during inference. We show the
benefits of DP guided quantization over pure PCA in Appendix B.9.
3.3 E NTROPY CODING
Finally, the quantized values are packed into a single byte array and further compressed using the
DEFLATE algorithm (Wu, 2017). Crucially, we leverage nvCOMP (NVIDIA, 2020), which enables
parallel operation directly on a GPU. This step is lossless, but the added compression ratio is content-
dependent. We ablate the choice of the lossless compression algorithm and the influence on final
compression in Appendix B.8.
4 E XPERIMENTS
Models We use models from three families: Llama 3 (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Mistral NeMo
(Mistral AI team, 2024; Sreenivas et al., 2024), and R1-distilled Qwen 2.5 (DeepSeek-AI et al.,
2025). The selection includes models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters of base, instruct, and
reasoning kind. Table 1 lists the models along with their KV cache sizes. Notably, MN-Minitron 8B
has been pruned from the Mistral NeMo 12B base, retaining the original KV cache size.
Methods We compare our method against KIVI (Liu et al., 2024d), GEAR (Kang et al., 2024)
and an FP8 quantization of KV cache to the E4M3 format (Micikevicius et al., 2022). For eviction
baselines, we compare with TOV A (Oren et al., 2024) and H 2O (Zhang et al., 2023). For SVD
baselines, we compare our method with xKV (Chang et al., 2025). Finally, we compare kvtc with
DMS (Ła ´ncucki et al., 2025), a trained token eviction method, on reasoning tasks.
For all methods, we follow their original intended protocols, performing prefill in the vanilla mode
and compressing the KV cache only after the self-attention has been calculated. For every method
except xKV , we simulate a sequence of short conversations by running compression/eviction on the
cache every c tokens, where c depends on the method’s original sliding window policy. For kvtc
which is run with a sliding windoww = 128, we compress/decompress everyc = 16 tokens, leaving
the window in the 112–128 token range. In the case of xKV , we compress only the prefill tokens,

providing it with an advantage, since xKV is specifically designed for prefill optimization, and re-
computing SVD matrices for newly decoded tokens would be prohibitively time-consuming. For a
fair comparison, we only report the prefill compression ratios for non-Qwen models.
Notation-wise,kvtcCR× denoteskvtc in the default setting, where CR is the target compression
for the DP. For all methods, we calculate CR only on the compressed tokens, not counting the sliding
window tokens.
Tasks We evaluate compression effects on Llama 3.1 8B, MN-Minitron 8B and Mistral NeMo
12B across the following task categories, with results presented in Table 2:
• Math & Knowledge: 8-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), 4-shot CoT
MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a)
• Long Context Performance : 0-shot key-value retrieval task from (Liu et al., 2024a) (denoted
LITM), 1-shot RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024) Variable Tracking (denoted RULER-VT), and 2-shot
Qasper (Shaham et al., 2022). In Appendix B.13 we provide an extended long context evaluation
using 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020), MultiFieldQA (Bai et al., 2024), MuSiQue (Trivedi
et al., 2022), QMSum (Zhong et al., 2021), SAMSum (Gliwa et al., 2019) from LongBench (Bai
et al., 2024) and Common/Frequent Words Extraction (CWE/FWE), Needle in a Haystack (NIAH)
(Kamradt, 2023), HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018), SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; 2018) from
RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024), showing that kvtc can still maintain performance comparable to
vanilla with approximately 20× compression ratio.
We evaluate R1-distilled models on challenging mathematical competitions AIME 2024-2025 (Art
of Problem Solving, 2025) and coding tasks from LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2025), with results
presented in Table 3. We additionally evaluate kvtc with Llama 3.3 70B Instruct on MATH-500
(Hendrycks et al., 2021b; Lightman et al., 2023), the key-value retrieval task from (Liu et al., 2024a)
and Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) (Kamradt, 2023; Hsieh et al., 2024), with results presented in
Table 4. Detailed evaluation protocols can be found in Appendix A, and ablations and details about
parameter choices forkvtc in Appendix B.
Calibration Data We sample a 1:1 mixture of short and long documents, with lengths in the 1–8K
and 8–32K ranges, respectively. Rotary positional embeddings are removed for calibration; further
details are provided in Appendix B.1. Ablations showing kvtc stability and generalization across
domains of the calibration data are provided in Appendices B.5 and B.6.

4.1 R ESULTS
In all experiments, kvtc applies the same compression ratio to both the key and value caches. An
ablation of their individual compressibility is presented in Table 7 (Appendix B), suggesting that
further adjustments could yield additional gains.
General-Purpose Base Models We evaluatekvtc on general-purpose models at the 8–12B scale,
featuring three GQA-enabled models (Table 2). The compression ratio of kvtc varies due to the
data-dependent nature of the DEFLATE algorithm, which, on average, achieves a compression
ratio of approximately 1.23× on top of quantization. Crucially, kvtc maintains high accuracy
across tested tasks, even at substantial compression ratios of 32× and 64×. Conversely, quantiza-
tion methods—GEAR and KIVI—exhibit signs of performance degradation on GSM8K and Lost
in the Middle tasks at 5× CR; cache eviction methods such as H 2O and TOV A perform poorly as
generic KV cache compressors. We also note that xKV performs well across most tasks, except
for Qasper. Interestingly, in certain cases,kvtc at very high compression ratios even surpasses the
performance of the vanilla models. A similar observation was made in (Ła ´ncucki et al., 2025) for a
token eviction method; we provide additional insights in Appendix B.6, Table 11. Crucially, kvtc
at 16× compression (approximately 20× after DEFLATE) consistently maintains results within< 1
score point (accuracy or F1, depending on the task) of the vanilla models. The standard errors for
these results are reported in Table 19 (Appendix B.12).

Reasoning Models In order to test kvtc under
more challenging conditions where context plays
a critical role, we use complex math and coding
tasks (Table 3). Due to high variability, AIME
results are averaged over eight independent runs
with results reported as score±std. On coding
tasks, kvtc8× shows minor accuracy drops of
0.3pp for the 1.5B model and 0.2pp for the 7B
model. Notably, the KV cache size of the 1.5B
model is already small at 29 KiB/token, compared
to 131 KiB/token for Llama 3.1 8B, and a 9 ×
compression shrinks it to only 3.2 KiB/token. We
also compare our method against DMS, a state-
of-the-art autoregressive KV cache token eviction
method. DMS achieves competitive results, and
since it employs token eviction, it could potentially
be combined withkvtc for even lower KV cache
footprint.
Multi-GPU Inference To investigate attainable compression ratios for models distributed across
multiple GPUs, we evaluate kvtc using Llama 3.3 70B (Table 4). The model runs in a pipeline-
parallel setting (Hu et al., 2021) on four GPUs, each handling 20 layers. We maintain a local KV
cache on each GPU, applying kvtc separately. Accuracy drops on the MATH-500 task are within
1.5 × stderr, with accuracy decreasing by 1.2pp at 10× compression and 3.0pp at 20×.
Latency We calculate the latency of elements of the compression pipeline and provide the results
in Table 5. In contrast to full re-computation of KV cache for 8K context length, kvtc16× can
reduce time-to-first-token (TTFT) up to 8×.
5 L IMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Online Compression and Composability with Other Methods kvtc was designed for efficient
storage and reducing time-to-first-token. However, the advantage of having a single, generalizable
PCA matrix for initial compression of cache renders it suitable for further exploration of inference
directly in the principal component space. We leave this as future work. Notably, kvtc does not
alter the structure of KV cache and does not change how the attention is calculated. Consequently,
it is directly compatible with token eviction methods, including but not limited to these used in the

Multi-head Latent Attention (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024).
Scalability and Generalization Limits We approximate deployment by evaluating kvtc on
benchmark tasks in simulated multi-turn settings, which may not fully reflect real content distri-
butions or interaction patterns. Our experiments cover dense decoder-only models from 1.5B to 70B
parameters; evaluating larger models under conditions that more accurately mirror production is left
for future work. For calibration, we process approximately 200K tokens on a single NVIDIA H100
SXM 80GB GPU. Under these settings, computing the PCA basis with the randomized algorithm
of Halko et al. (2011) completes within minutes. As shown in Figures 6, 10 and 11, increasing
the calibration set size consistently reduces the Frobenius-norm reconstruction error. Scalingkvtc
beyond 200K tokens, primarily a matter of scaling the computation of PCA, is left for future work.
Finally, we report Frobenius-norm reconstruction error as a proxy for downstream task accuracy.
While convenient, this metric does not guarantee task-level gains and its predictive power may be
task-dependent. We provide an initial correlation analysis in Appendix B.5 and defer a systematic
study of alternative proxies to future work. Finally, the compression and decompression times of
kvtc can be substantially reduced via kernel fusion and hierarchical PCA: first at the level of in-
dividual layers, then across groups of layers. Nevertheless, even a simple implementation yields
substantial benefits and, in many cases, incurs only marginal overhead.
6 R ELATED WORK
Tuning-Free Quantization Quantization-based methods that avoid model fine-tuning offer a
straightforward path to KV cache compression (Zhao et al., 2024; Sheng et al., 2023). Works such
as KIVI (Liu et al., 2024d) and KVQuant (Hooper et al., 2024) have advanced this direction by
developing separate quantization strategies for key and value embeddings. These methods leverage
the observation that keys benefit from per-channel quantization, while values are better suited to
per-token quantization. Our approach diverges from these methods by first projecting concatenated
embeddings from attention layers using SVD matrices derived from a calibration set. Quantization
is then applied in this transformed space, with the precision dynamically optimized via dynamic
programming bit allocation. While we adopt KIVI’s uniform quantization scheme, our application
occurs in the SVD-transformed domain. Similar to KVQuant, we apply compression before RoPE
(Su et al., 2024) to preserve model quality.
Tuning-Based Quantization A complementary approach to post-training quantization involves
fine-tuning models to adapt to quantized activations. LLM-QAT (Liu et al., 2024c) leverages gen-
erations from the pre-quantized model for fine-tuning, while BitDistiller (Du et al., 2024) merges
Quantization Aware Training (Jacob et al., 2018) with Knowledge Distillation (Hinton et al., 2015)
In contrast, our method eliminates the need for parameter modifications.

Singular Value Decomposition Approaches SVD has emerged as a straightforward method for
removing the redundancy in KV caches and exploiting its low-rank structure. GEAR (Kang et al.,
2024) improves quantization through low-rank correction mechanisms, whereas LoRC (Zhang et al.,
2024) minimizes computational overhead by directly reducing the rank of key and value matri-
ces. Eigen Attention (Saxena et al., 2024) restructures attention computation by projecting into a
truncated subspace defined by SVD, enabling efficient operations. A similar mechanism could be
devised for value vectors inkvtc, and key vectors for layers that do not employ positional embed-
dings. GEAR (Kang et al., 2024) improves KIVI quantization through low-rank correction mecha-
nisms. Building on ShadowKV (Sun et al., 2025), SVDq (Yankun et al., 2025) integrates SVD with
quantization, leveraging singular value magnitudes for a simple precision allocation; xKV (Chang
et al., 2025) aggregates KV caches across multiple layers before decomposition. This work differs
in three respects: (i) it models rotational relationships between non-adjacent layers to enable cross-
layer concatenation before decomposition; (ii) it selects ranks and bitwidths via a dynamic program
under a compression budget; and (iii) it applies entropy coding to the quantized factors. Empirical
comparisons and ablations (e.g., treatment of early sink tokens) are reported in Appendix B.
Sparse Attention Strategies Sparse attention mechanisms provide a complementary paradigm
for managing sequence length dimensions by selectively discarding non-essential keys/values dur-
ing inference. Techniques such as H 2O (Zhang et al., 2023) and TOV A (Oren et al., 2024) employ
prioritization strategies to dynamically prune less informative elements from the KV cache. In con-
trast, chunk-based approaches like Quest (Tang et al., 2024), Landmark Attention (Mohtashami &
Jaggi, 2023), and Native Sparse Attention (Yuan et al., 2025) construct compressed representations
of the KV cache by partitioning sequences into chunks. These methods retrieve only the most critical
chunks during attention computation, significantly reducing the number of memory transfers. Con-
currently, dynamic compression techniques such as Dynamic Memory Compression (Nawrot et al.,
2024) and Dynamic Memory Sparsification (Ła ´ncucki et al., 2025) optimize KV cache memory us-
age through pooling/eviction of keys/values. These strategies could be integrated with quantization
and SVD methods to achieve further gains (Yankun et al., 2025).
Transform Coding Transform coding underpins media codecs because it decorrelates local struc-
ture and compacts energy into a few coefficients, enabling aggressive quantization and entropy cod-
ing of the resulting sparse residuals (Ahmed et al., 1974; Wallace, 1992; ISO & IEC, 1998; JVT,
2003; Sze et al., 2014). Similar low-frequency structure might appear in neural models, motivating
transform coding for activations and compression-aware training (Baskin et al., 2021; Young et al.,
2021), or repurposing hardware H.264/H.265 encoders as codecs for LLM weights and KV caches
(Xu et al., 2025). Our approach similarly builds on the transform coding paradigm. However, rather
than relying on existing algorithms, we design a novel combination of decorrelation, quantization
and entropy coding, which exploits cross-layer dependencies to achieve higher compression ratios.
Cache Management Systems Finally, cache management systems address the operational chal-
lenges of KV cache handling in production environments. Paged Attention (Kwon et al., 2023)
mitigates memory overhead by introducing chunked memory allocation for KV caches. Continuous
batching techniques, as implemented in systems like vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) and FasterTrans-
former (NVIDIA, 2021), optimize device utilization by enabling parallel processing of multiple
sequences. CacheGen (Liu et al., 2024b) advanced the field with a distributed framework for long-
term KV cache management, incorporating compression, streaming, and cross-node coordination.
Our approach extends these systems by integrating fine-grained compression capabilities.
7 C ONCLUSION
We introducekvtc, a method for compressing KV cache up to 20 × with negligible quality degra-
dation, and higher compression ratios of 40 × or more available for specific use cases. We empiri-
cally show that key and value caches exhibit substantial redundancy, which kvtc exploits through
a simple, transform coding pipeline. It is built around linear dimensionality reduction and a dy-
namic programming algorithm, which assigns variable numbers of bits to principal components. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of kvtc across both regular and thinking model families, evaluat-
ing models from 1.5B to 70B. We believe that kvtc paves the way towards more efficient LLM
deployments, lowering the cost of LLM-assisted iterative workflows.

REPRODUCIBILITY
To foster reproducibility of our results, we provide extensive details about the calibration of PCA
matrices in Appendix B.1 along with ablations regardingkvtc parameters in Appendices B.3 (sink
tokens), B.4 (key vs value compressibility), B.5 (amount of calibration data), B.6 (effect of cali-
bration data domain) and B.7 (sliding window). In Appendix A, we present the details about the
evaluation setup: tasks, used prompts, and baseline configuration. We note that we utilize LM Eval-
uation Harness (Gao et al., 2024) and RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024) for evaluation, which are publicly
available. In Appendix B.17 we provide the pseudocode for the dynamic programming precision
assignment algorithm along with the sketch of the optimality proof and complexity analysis.
ETHICAL STATEMENT
As a method that aims to improve aspects regarding LLM usage, kvtc does not introduce new
risks. However, we note that it can amplify existing ones. Therefore, we refer to the existing
body of knowledge on the ethical risks of LLM development, such as Ethics Threats in LLM-Based
Agents (Gan et al., 2024), potential reversal of safety alignment (Xu et al., 2024), and more general
risks regarding LLMs (Li & Fung, 2025).

APPENDIX
A E VALUATION DETAILS
A.1 T ASKS
For evaluation, we utilize Language Model Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2024) and RULER
(Hsieh et al., 2024) with the Transformers library (Hugging Face, 2025b) serving as an inference
backend.
A.1.1 GSM8K
GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) is an established task for the evaluation of the reasoning of non-
reasoning models (models without thinking phase ( <think>...</think>) before answer)
(Yang et al., 2025). We evaluate it in an 8-shot CoT setting with few-shot examples from (Wei
et al., 2022). Following (Meta, 2024) we allow for the generation of up to 1024 tokens. Task name
in LM Evaluation Harness isgsm8k cot.
GSM8K 8-shot prompt example
Q: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the grove today. After they are
done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did the grove workers plant today?,→
A: There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more were planted. So there
must have been 21 - 15 = 6. The answer is 6.,→
Q: If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking
lot?,→
A: There are originally 3 cars. 2 more cars arrive. 3 + 2 = 5. The answer is 5.
Q: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in
total?,→
A: Originally, Leah had 32 chocolates. Her sister had 42. So in total they had 32 + 42 = 74. After
eating 35, they had 74 - 35 = 39. The answer is 39.,→
Q: Jason had 20 lollipops. He gave Denny some lollipops. Now Jason has 12 lollipops. How many
lollipops did Jason give to Denny?,→
A: Jason started with 20 lollipops. Then he had 12 after giving some to Denny. So he gave Denny 20 -
12 = 8. The answer is 8.,→
Q: Shawn has five toys. For Christmas, he got two toys each from his mom and dad. How many toys does
he have now?,→
A: Shawn started with 5 toys. If he got 2 toys each from his mom and dad, then that is 4 more toys. 5
+ 4 = 9. The answer is 9.,→
Q: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from
monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?,→
A: There were originally 9 computers. For each of 4 days, 5 more computers were added. So 5 * 4 = 20
computers were added. 9 + 20 is 29. The answer is 29.,→
Q: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How
many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?,→
A: Michael started with 58 golf balls. After losing 23 on tuesday, he had 58 - 23 = 35. After losing
2 more, he had 35 - 2 = 33 golf balls. The answer is 33.,→
Q: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
A: Olivia had 23 dollars. 5 bagels for 3 dollars each will be 5 x 3 = 15 dollars. So she has 23 - 15
dollars left. 23 - 15 is 8. The answer is 8.,→

A.1.2 MMLU
MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) is a collection of multiple-choice questions spanning 57 subjects.
For MMLU evaluation, we use 4-shot mmlu flan cot fewshot from LM Evaluation Harness,
allowing for generation of up to 256 tokens. We pick this setup instead of the perplexity-based
forward-pass evaluation of MMLU, because our baselines perform a prefill using full precision KV
cache. Therefore, for a fair evaluation, we need to make the model generate a non-zero number of
tokens before providing the answer, as otherwise the performance would be identical to vanilla.
MMLU 4-shot prompt example
The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about abstract algebra.Q: Statement 1 |
Every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of the group. Statement 2 | The symmetric
group S_10 has 10 elements.
,→
,→
(A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True
A: Let's think step by step. A cyclic group is a group that is generated by a single element. Hence a
subgroup generated by a single element of a group is cyclic and Statement 1 is True. The answer
is (C).
,→
,→
Q: The symmetric group $S_n$ has $
actorial{n}$ elements, hence it is not true that $S_{10}$ has 10 elements.
Find the characteristic of the ring 2Z.
(A) 0 (B) 3 (C) 12 (D) 30
A: Let's think step by step. A characteristic of a ring is R is $n$ if the statement $ka = 0$ for all
$a\in 2Z$ implies that $k$ is a multiple of $n$. Assume that $ka = 0$ for all $a\in 2Z$ for some
$k$. In particular $2k = 0$. Hence $k=0$ and $n=0$. The answer is (A).
,→
,→
Q: Statement 1| Every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one. Statement 2 | Every
subgroup of an abelian group is abelian.,→
(A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True
A: Let's think step by step. Statement 1 is true. Let $S$ be a finite set. If $f:S
ightarrow S$ is a onto function, then $|S| = |f(S)|$. If $f$ was not one to one, then for finite
domain $S$ the image would have less than $S$ elements, a contradiction.,→
Statement 2 is true. Let $G$ be an abelian group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. We need to show that
$H$ is abelian. Let $a,b \in H$. Then $a,b \in G$ and $ab=ba$. Since $G$ is abelian, $ab=ba$.
Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, $ab \in H$. Therefore, $ab=ba$ and $H$ is abelian. The answer is
(A).
,→
,→
,→
Q: Statement 1 | If aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|. Statement 2 | If H and
K are subgroups of G then HK is a subgroup of G.,→
(A) True, True (B) False, False (C) True, False (D) False, True
A: Let's think step by step. Statement 2 is false. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $S_3$ generated by the
cycle $(1,2)$ and $K$ be a subgroup of $S_3$ generated by the cycle $(1,3)$. Both $H$ and $K$
have two elements, the generators and the identity. However $HK$ contains cycles (1,2), (1,3) and
(2,3,1), but the inverse of (2,3,1) is (2,1,3) and it does not belong to HK, hence HK is not a
subgroup. The answer is (B).

A.1.3 L OST IN THE MIDDLE
Lost in the Middle (Liu et al., 2024a) is evaluated in a 0-shot 100-keys (300 keys for Llama 3.3
70B) setup, allowing generation of 64 tokens using the prompt presented below. We implement the
evaluation using the LM Evaluation Harness framework and utilize the UUID strings and code from
(Liu et al., 2024a). This benchmark allows for methodical testing of the model’s ability to access
the input context. As an evaluation metric, we utilize the exact match between the UUID returned
by the model and the gold answer.

A.2 B ASELINES CONFIGURATION
A.2.1 KIVI
We follow (Liu et al., 2024d, Section 4.1) and usegroup size = 32 andresidual length =
128, with 2-bits per key and 2-bits per value. We utilize the official implementation.
A.2.2 GEAR
We follow (Kang et al., 2024) github repository and set underlying quantization to KIVI withgroup
size = 64, streaming gap = 64, 2-bit keys and values. Additionally, we set the rank of
key/value correction to 4 for prefill and 2 for generation. We utilize the official implementation.
A.2.3 XKV
We follow (Chang et al., 2025). For Llama 3.1 8B we group layers by 4 and set the pre-RoPE key
rank to 512 (compression ratio 8) and value rank to 768 (compression rank 5 1
3). For Mistral NeMo
and MN-Minitron, we group layers by 5 (those models have 1.25 more layers than Llama 3.1 8B)
and set the pre-RoPE key rank to640 (compression ratio 8) and value rank to960 (compression rank
5 1
3). We utilize the official implementation.
A.2.4 H2O
We utilize the official implementation of (Zhang et al., 2023) and set the recent and heavy hitter
fractions to 1
16 of (input + max possible output size). This results in up to an 8x compression
ratio. Lower compression ratios occur when the model produces shorter outputs than the maximal
specified value. We note that this can give an advantage to H2O over other methods.
A.2.5 TOVA
We utilize the official implementation of (Oren et al., 2024) and set the max cache size to1
8 of (input
+ possible output size). This results in up to an 8x compression ratio. Lower compression ratios
occur when the model produces shorter outputs than the maximal specified value. We note that this
can give an advantage to TOV A over other methods.
A.2.6 DMS
We report the results for DMS as published in Ła´ncucki et al. (2025).
A.3 H ARDWARE
Experiments were run on a node with 8 × NVIDIA H100 GPUs (80 GB each). All main jobs
finished within 4 h, except MMLU and Llama-3.3-70B ( ≤ 8 h) and xKV ( ≤ 12 h). For baselines
(KIVI, GEAR, xKV , TOV A, H2O) we used the authors’ public code. All runs used batch size 1
(except Qwen and vLLM evaluations) to prevent padding that could bias some of the baselines.

B.1 PCA CALCULATION PARAMETERS
As mentioned in the main text, we utilize8 iterations of the randomized algorithm from (Halko et al.,
2011) for PCA. We utilize 160K calibration tokens for Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.3 70B instruct, Mistral
NeMo 12B, and MN-Minitron 8B with a dimensionality cut-off of10K. This choice is motivated by
memory efficiency and the results presented in Figures 6, 10 and 11, where the initial boost from the
increase in the number of calibration tokens from 10K to 100K is relatively large compared to the
boost attained when increasing from 100K to 160K. We leave the exploration of larger calibration
sets for future work. In Appendix B.5 we ablate the influence of the amount of the calibration data
on downstream results. In Appendix B.14 we provide the sizes of the projection matrices, noting
that they are relatively small when compared to the model size (2.4% of model parameters for Llama
3.3 70B) .
For Qwen models, due to their smaller number of KV heads, we utilize200K calibration tokens and
dimensionality reduction of 8K. For all models (unless stated otherwise), we utilize a 50/50 mixture
of FineWeb (Penedo et al., 2024) and OpenR1Math traces (Open R1, 2025) due to the duality of our
benchmarks (reasoning and general purpose; see Appendix B.6 for an ablation on calibration data
source). We take samples from both datasets with the only filters being minimum and maximum
length (1K and 32K, respectively) for both datasets and quality score ( ≥ 0.95) for FineWeb (the
quality score is attached to the dataset). Additionally, we ensure that the number of tokens from
documents below 8000 and above 8000 tokens is roughly the same (except in the MN-Minitron
case, as this model supports up to 8K context length). Token counts and cutoffs are chosen so that a
single calculation of PCA fits on a single H100 GPU with 80GB of memory and completes within
10 minutes (for details see Appendix B.5).
We emphasize that for a given model, we use the same PCA matrix for all compression ratios. The
only change between compression ratios is the precision assignment, which is done automatically
via a dynamic programming algorithm. Additionally, we note that the manual adjustment needed by
a practitioner to adapt kvtc to a new model is limited to choosing the initial PCA dimensionality
cutoff (if the practitioner decides to use the efficient algorithm by (Halko et al., 2011)), the number
of samples that the chosen PCA implementation can handle (based on GPU/CPU memory) and the
calibration sample choice if special scenarios are desired for increased compression. In this paper,
we note that across a wide range of tasks, the choice of a 50/50 mixture of both short and long
context FineWeb (Penedo et al., 2024) (for generic text) and OpenR1Math (Open R1, 2025) (for
thinking traces) data is sufficient for Llama, Mistral, and R1-distilled Qwen models for a variety of
applications. In particular, we note that our method is not harder to adjust than xKV or SVDq, due
to automatic precision assignment via dynamic programming. In particular, instead of aiming for
the best reconstruction error for a specific compression ratio, the user can easily alter the algorithm
to aim for the highest compression ratio within a given reconstruction error constraint.

B.2 A DDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT KV C ACHE PROPERTIES
We study the relative channel activation patterns of Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral-Nemo 12B and Qwen 2.5
R1 (Figures 7 and 8). The relative activation results are computed on a 50/50 mixture of FineWeb
(Penedo et al., 2024) and OpenR1Math (Open R1, 2025), with document lengths between 1K and 8K
tokens. We observe that keys and values of all models show potential for dimensionality reduction
and quantization (low absolute activations and variance).

B.3 E XCLUDING SINK TOKENS FROM COMPRESSION
We consider the first four tokens of key and value caches (i.e., tokens at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3)
to be sink tokens, motivated by the experimental results reported by (Xia et al., 2024). Reducing
the dimensionality of key and value caches with PCA causes larger information loss of the initial
tokens than the remaining ones, as shown in Figure 6. In order to assess the influence, we compare
two setups: one that excludes first four tokens from compression (denoted kvtc▶4) and one that
compresses them along with other tokens (denoted kvtc▶0). The results are shown in Table 6.
High compression ratio of 64× drastically reduces downstream task scores for the Llama 3.1 8B
in the kvtc▶0 case; for MN-Minitron 8B and Mistral NeMo 12B it causes regression on the long
context tasks (Lost in the Middle and Variable Tracking) when compared withkvtc▶4.
Table 6: Ablation on the skipping compression of the first four tokens. We note that the difference
starts to be visible with larger compression ratios, and that it is in favor of skipping compression
of potential attention sinks (Xiao et al., 2024). Results are presented as scorestderr where stderr
is bootstraped by LM Evaluation Harness (where available) (Gao et al., 2024). The differences in
compression ratios, are due to the fact that we count the skipped tokens into compression ratio.

B.4 S EPARATE ADJUSTMENT OF COMPRESSION RATIOS FOR KEY AND VALUE CACHES
All experimental results of kvtc (unless stated otherwise) have been obtained with 1:1 compres-
sion of keys and values. We present additional results of manually adjusting the compression ratio
separately for keys and values (Table 7). The results suggest that for long-context retrieval tasks,
the value cache could be compressed more than the key cache. We attribute this phenomenon to the
necessity to precisely attend to selected tokens in the cache, which hinges on the high accuracy of
key vectors. On the other hand, stronger compression of values shows a noticeable degradation on
the GSM8K and MMLU tasks.
Table 7: Ablation of key/value compressibility withkvtc. We use the samekvtc configuration as
in Table 2, but independently change key and value lossy compression rates. To denote that value
compression ratio was set to 32 and key was set to 64 we usekvtc▶0

Figure 9: Model perplexity under differ-
ent CRs and calibration token budgets.
We test how the amount of calibration data affects cal-
ibration times and the downstream performance. From
Figures 10 and 11 we already know that increasing the
amount of the calibration data can bring down the recon-
struction error. The question that remains is how such
an increase correlates with the downstream performance.
In Table 8 we show that an increase in calibration data
clearly benefits a high compression ratio of 256×, with
more moderate returns for smaller ( 64×, 32×) compres-
sion ratios. This is a positive result, as it allows for
trading calibration stage complexity for improved down-
stream performance, with 40K token budget bringing al-
ready competitive results for 64× ratio. We additionally
note that PCA calibration can be completed within 1.5
minutes for 160K tokens using (Halko et al., 2011) algo-
rithm, and that the DP calculation time (performed once
per model and compression ratio) can be finalized within 8 minutes.
Table 8: Ablation of the number of tokens used forkvtc calibration, along with respective PCA and
DP calibration times. PCA calibration was performed using single H100 80GB GPU, calculation
of DP tables (except simulation of quantization) was offloaded to the node cpu. We additionally
limit DP calibration data to first 32K tokens, therefore we do not see increase in dp time after 40k
calibration tokens. All calibration datapieces come from a 50/50 mixture of FineWeb (Penedo et al.,
2024) and OpenMathR1 (Open R1, 2025) traces between 1K and 8K tokens. Reconstruction error
and perplexity calculated on n a held-out 50/50 mixture of FineWeb and OpenR1Math data.

B.6 C ALIBRATION DATA DOMAIN VS DOWNSTREAM PERFORMANCE
To examine how the calibration data domain influences downstream performance, we prepare two
additional versions ofkvtc for Mistral NeMo12B: one using only FineWeb data and the other using
only OpenR1Math data. Table 9 shows that using OpenR1Math calibration data better maintains
MMLU and key-value retrieval scores than FineWeb at higher compression rates. This improvement
is likely related to the question-think-answer structure of OpenR1Math, which may be more aligned
with the evaluation tasks, compared to the more general web collection nature of FineWeb. However,
for 32× compression, both choices remain competitive. We note that for 256× compression, the
50/50 mixture of FineWeb and OpenR1Math results in the best scores. For reconstruction errors,
regarding calibrating on OpenR1Math/FineWeb and testing on FineWeb/OpenR1Math, see Figures
10 and 11.
We additionally check the standard deviation of task scores when sampling different calibration
sets (see Table 10). We observe that kvtc is relatively stable when sampling 160K tokens — a
50/50 mixture of FineWeb and OpenR1Math data — as a calibration set. We also briefly check the
influence of calibration data length distribution on downstream performance, showing the results in
Table 11.
In Table 12, we test kvtc calibration under strong domain shifts. We observe that using Python,
C, or Assembly from StarCoder (Li et al., 2023) instead of a 50/50 mixture of FineWeb and
OpenR1Math data results in performance degradation on GSM8K. However, we note that despite
a strong domain shift (code vs natural language), the model retains in-context retrieval abilities
(LITM, RULER-VT) and for cr16× obtains scores that are either on par or better than KIVI/GEAR
2-bit (except the case when we calibrate on C). We note that files contained in StarCoder consist of
both code and comments, which can potentially explain retention of lingual abilities.
Table 9: Ablation of the source of data. We consider kvtc calibrated fully on FineWeb (Penedo
et al., 2024), fully on OpenMathR1 (Open R1, 2025) and a 50/50 mixture. For all cases we utilize
a 50/50 mix of documents between 1K and 8K tokens along with documents between 8K and 32K
tokens. We calibrate using 160K tokens.

B.7 S LIDING WINDOW SIZE VS DOWNSTREAM PERFORMANCE
We ablate the influence of sliding window of recent not-compressed tokens on downstream perfor-
mance in Table 13. We observe that increasing the length of sliding window improves downstream
performance of the model, with most noticeable difference between sliding windows ≤ 16 and
sliding windows ≥ 64.
Table 13: Ablation of the sliding window size of recent tokens that are not compressed. For a
fair compression in this table we simulate a sequence of short conversations by running compress-
ing/eviction on the cache every s = 1 instead every s = 16 tokens. Therefore, the w = 16 token
window is left int the range 15-16 instead of 0-16.

B.8 A BLATIONS OF LOSSLESS COMPRESSION
We ablate the differences between:
• ANS (Duda, 2014)
• Bitcomp with default nvCOMP settings (NVIDIA, 2020)
• DEFLATE (Wu, 2017) (Huffman (Huffman, 1952) + LZ77 (RASIP working group, 1997))
• GDeflate (NVIDIA, 2022)
• LZ4 (Collet, 2011)
• Snappy (Google, 2011)
• Zstandard (Facebook, 2015)
• Identity — no additional lossless compression
We present the results in Table 14. We note that DEFLATE can be easily substituted by a faster
GDeflate optimized for GPUs, as the highest measured difference in compression ratio is≤ 0.1. We
observe that the cache generated for RULER Variable Tracking is significantly more compressible
than the cache generated for other tasks. We hypothesize that it may be an effect of repeated noise
used as context filler by the authors (see Appendix A). We observe that ANS, DEFLATE, GDe-
flate, and Zstandard improve significantly over Identity in all studied cases. For a detailed study of
throughput vs compression ratio of tested algorithms, we refer to (NVIDIA, 2024).
Table 14: Ablation of the lossless compression algorithms, performed using Mistral Nemo 12B with
kvtc32×. Identity stands for no additional lossless compression (just PCA + DP Quantization;
note that we count the omitted sinks into compression ratio, what is notable for tasks with shorter
contexts). We mark results that have no compression ratio advantage over Identity smaller than 1 in
red.

B.9 B ENEFITS OF DP QUANTIZATION
We comparekvtc to a variant that does not use DP quantization, but instead removes a fraction of
the least important principal components (denoted -DPQ). The results are presented in Table 15. We
observe that removing PCA components, rather than applying DP quantization, leads to significant
performance degradation on long context tasks. Additionally, the performance of DPQ on short
context tasks deteriorates further as the length of the sliding window of uncompressed elements is
reduced. We also note that DEFLATE can be much more efficient on quantized data. In general,
our findings demonstrate that quantization is a crucial component of kvtc, and omitting it hinders
scaling to larger compression ratios.
Table 15: Ablation of the importance of DP quantization over pure PCA. For alteration of sliding
window size we follow the protocol from Appendix B.7.

B.10 PCA FEATURE CONCAT SIZE VS PERFORMANCE
We study how the number of layers over which we concatenate key/value heads influences the per-
formance of kvtc. We present the results in Tables 16 and 17. To better isolate the influence of
the number of concatenated key/value heads, we run kvtc without dynamic programming quanti-
zation (that is, we runkvtc-DPQ introduced in Appendix B.9) and with a sliding window w = 16.
We note that results support our hypothesis about cross-layer similarity between key/value heads
from Section 2, as the more layers we concatenate for calibration (PCA), the better the downstream
performance.
Table 16: Ablation of the number of layers used for PCA. To better isolate the influence of the
number of concatenated key/value heads, we runkvtc without dynamic programming quantization
(that is, we runkvtc-DPQ introduced in Appendix B.9) and with a sliding window w = 16.

B.11 PCA DIFFERENT PER -PROMPT VS ONE -TIME
Table 18: Ablation of PCA Calibration. We follow the protocol described in Table 17. Conversation
simulation proceeds as follows: the model maintains a window of only 16 uncompressed recent
tokens and performs compression each time a new token is generated. We note that per-prompt
calibration results in significantly lower compression ratios, owing to the overhead of storing the
per-prompt projection matrix V T . Moreover, a per-prompt V T can generalize poorly and fail to
compress the continuation of the conversation effectively.

B.13 A DDITIONAL LONG BENCH AND RULER RESULTS
We additionally evaluate kvtc on 2WikiMultiHopQA (2WQA) (Ho et al., 2020), MultiFieldQA
(MFQA) (Bai et al., 2024), MuSiQue (MQUE) (Trivedi et al., 2022), QMSum (QMS) (Zhong et al.,
2021), SAMSum (SAMS) (Gliwa et al., 2019) from LongBench (Bai et al., 2024). We also evaluate
on Common/Frequent Words Extraction (CWE/FWE), Needle in a Haystack (NIAH) (Kamradt,
2023), HotPotQA (HPQA) (Yang et al., 2018), SQuAD (SQA) (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; 2018) from
RULER (Hsieh et al., 2024). We present the results in Table 20, showing thatkvtc can still maintain
comparable performance to vanilla with ≈ 20× compression ratio.
Table 20: Additional results (with stderr) on LongBench (1 host) and RULER (0 shot) tasks, methods
configured as in Table 2. Given the RULER 0-shot QA results we hypothesize that both Llama 3.1
8B and MN-Minitron 8B base models were exposed to some amount of question answering data
with format similar to the mentioned tasks, whereas it might have not been the case for Mistral
NeMo 12B.

B.14 PCA MATRIX SIZES
In Table 21 we present the sizes of PCA projection matrices (V from UΣV ⊤) after being computed
via (Halko et al., 2011) algorithm. We note that the sizes are only a relatively small fraction of
the model parameters, and that they can be further reduced by the DP algorithm depending on the
desired compression ratio.
Table 21: Number of parameters used by PCA matrices, before DP, for the tested models. For
example, Llama 3.1 8B has 32 layers, each with 8 key/value heads, each head of size 128. Therefore,
after cross-head concatenation, each key/value has 32 × 8 × 128 = 32768 features. The PCA
projection V is cut to the first 10K principal components by (Halko et al., 2011) algorithm for
efficiency, resulting in 32768 × 10000 ≃ 328M parameters. Further DP bit allocation can remove
additional principal directions depending on the desired compression ratio. Both models and PCA
projection matrices are stored in 16bit precision.

B.15 C OMPRESSION RATIO WITH SLIDING WINDOW
For the presented methods and a sliding window of w uncompressed (high precision) keys/values
corresponding to recent tokens, one can use the following formulas to calculate the compression
ratio that includes the sliding window:
• kvtc▶s
cr×: ctx
ctx−w−s
cr +w+s/2 — we keep the first s tokens in FP8
• kvtccr×: ctx

• Other methods: ctx

B.16 LMC ACHE + VLLM
We provide additional end-to-end measurements in a simplified, multi-user scenario. To be more
precise, we have run vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) with LMCache (Cheng et al., 2025) managing the
KV cache on a workload in which, for ≈ 64K of initial input tokens, users ask questions that are
between 16 and 100 tokens and receive 100-token answers (1 token for TTFT measure), with no
delays in between conversation turns. We have used Llama 3.3 70B in FP8 precision, split over 2x
H100 80GB GPUs using tensor parallelism. LMCache has been configured to use 128GiB of host
(CPU DRAM) memory per GPU, which is equivalent to using 1TiB in an 8-GPU server. We present
the latency results in Table 22.
We observe that with 12 or more clients, the dedicated amount of host memory becomes too little
to hold the KV caches and forces recomputation, which is reflected in spiking latency. In a more
realistic scenario, there would be more concurrent users taking pauses between conversation turns.
We note that in this test, the KV cache is compressed with KVTC only for storage in host memory;
it does not take advantage of compressing the KV cache for storage in GPU HBM, which would
bring additional latency benefits, as its implementation is more involved.
Table 22: Response latency for generation of 100 tokens (left) and TTFT (right) vs. number of
concurrent vLLM clients. In both cases, the initial input context is sampled to have between 62K
and 66K tokens, and each user question is sampled to have between 16 and 100 tokens. We use the
same GPU for prefill, generation, compression, and decompression, which can result in increased
latency forkvtc.

Below, we present the pseudocode for the dynamic programming precision assignment along with a
proof sketch.

m = D.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True) # of each feature across the batch dimension
U, S, V = svd(D - m) # D - m = U @ S @ V.T
P = U@S # assume columns sorted by singular values
batch, num_considered_features = P.shape
# initial_reconstruction_error corresponds to quantizing everything with zero bits
initial_reconstruction_error = (P*P).sum() # squared Frobenius norm
# set to initial_reconstruction_error as we assume that the data is initially quantized with 0 bits
# and we progressively consider non-zero quantization of more and more features
best_error = tensor(shape=(num_considered_features + 1, max_bit_budget + 1),
values=initial_reconstruction_error),→
best_error_type = array(shape=(num_considered_features + 1, max_bit_budget + 1), values=0)
best_error_block_size = tensor(shape=(num_considered_features + 1, max_bit_budget + 1), values=0)
best_error_bit_cost = tensor(shape=(num_considered_features + 1, max_bit_budget + 1), values=0)
# we assume that block sizes are > 0
allowed_block_sizes = [1, 16, 64, 256, 1024]
# We assume the presence of a None type that quantizes data to the array of zeros.
# We count bit usage of this type as 0,
# because it directly corresponds to the removal of principal components.
types = [None, int2, int4, fp8]
for i in range(1, num_considered_features + 1):
for block_size in allowed_block_sizes:
if block_size <= i:
assert block_size > 0
for budget in range(1, max_bit_budget + 1):
if best_error[i, budget] > best_error[i, budget - 1]:
best_error[i, budget] = best_error[i, budget - 1]
best_error_type[i, budget] = best_error_type[i, budget - 1]
best_error_block_size[i, budget] = best_error_block_size[i, budget - 1]
best_error_bit_cost[i, budget] = best_error_bit_cost[i, budget - 1]
for t in types:
block_to_quantize = P[:, i - block_size:i]

if used_bits <= budget:
zero_bit_quantize_error = (block_to_quantize * block_to_quantize).sum()

best_error_block_size[i, budget] = block_size
best_error_bit_cost[i, budget] = used_bits
# we can use best_error, best_error_type, best_error_block_size and best_error_bit_cost tables to
get the quantization for a given budget,→
The proof of the optimality follows by simple induction on i andbudget. To be more precise we
want to prove that best error[j, q] is the smallest reconstruction error (squared Frobenius
norm) one can achieve when considering first j features of P (setting other features to 0 – 0-bit quan-
tization) and quantization restricted to types from types that can only be used to quantize blocks
of contiguous features of sizes in allowed block sizes sizes, while utilizing no more than
budget bits. For simplicity we assume that the smallest reconstruction error (squared Frobenius
norm) forq=0 budget cases isinitial reconstruction error = (P*P).sum(). Then
the proof by induction can be conducted as follows:
• For i=0 orbudget=0 we have that if we consider quantization of the first 0 features and
leave other features as zeros or budget of size 0, then the reconstruction error is indeed
(P*P).sum().
• Then to prove for i>0 and budget>0 we assume the optimality of best error[j,
q] forj<i, and forj=i andq<budget. Then we note that the algorithm enumerates all

possible quantization blocks that the quantization of the firsti features can end with within
the budgetbudget.
Computational complexity can be directly inferred from the pseudo-code:
O(num considered features×
|allowed block sizes|×
max bit budget×
|types|×
qsim(max{allowed block sizes}, batch))
where
qsim(max{allowed block sizes}, batch)
is the time taken to simulate quantization. Assuming that |allowed block sizes| and |types| are
constant and quantization simulation can be performed in
O(max{allowed block sizes} × batch)
we can write the asymptotic bound on the algorithm runtime as:
O(num considered features × max bit budget × batch)
We additionally provide the runtime of the algorithm in Table 8 in Appendix B.5.
