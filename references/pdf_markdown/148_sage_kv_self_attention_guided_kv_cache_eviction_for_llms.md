ABSTRACT
Efficient long-context inference is critical as large language models (LLMs) adopt
context windows of ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. However, the growing key-
value (KV) cache and the high computational complexity of attention create sig-
nificant bottlenecks in memory usage and latency. In this paper, we find that atten-
tion in diverse long-context tasks exhibits sparsity, and LLMs implicitly “know”
which tokens can be dropped or evicted at the head level after the pre-filling stage.
Based on this insight, we propose Self-Attention Guided Eviction (SAGE-KV), a
simple and effective KV eviction cache method for long-context inference. After
prefilling, our method performs a one-time top- k selection at both the token and
head levels to compress the KV cache, enabling efficient inference with the re-
duced cache. Evaluations on LongBench and three long-context LLMs (Llama3.1-
8B-Instruct-128k, Llama3-8B-Prolong-512k-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-
128k) show that SAGE-KV maintains accuracy comparable to full attention while
significantly improving efficiency. Specifically, SAGE-KV achieves 4x higher
memory efficiency with improved accuracy over the static KV cache selection
method StreamLLM, and 2x higher memory efficiency with better accuracy than
the dynamic KV cache selection method Quest.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) are essential for tasks like summarization, multi-
hop reasoning, question answering, code understanding, personalized chatbots, recommendations,
and in-context learning (Zhou et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Josh Achiam, 2023; Team et al., 2024).
However, their deployment is limited by high computational costs, driven by the KV cache’s memory
demands and attention computation latency (Li et al., 2024). As attention latency grows with KV
cache size, efficient memory and computation management are crucial for real-world feasibility.
Addressing these challenges is key to fully leveraging long-context LLMs.
Recent efforts to reduce KV cache requirements and accelerate inference in long-context LLMs
have gained increasing attention, mainly by exploiting attention sparsity (Zhang et al., 2023; Liu
et al., 2024). Sparsity patterns fall into two main categories: static (Xiao et al., 2024c;b) and dy-
namic (Xiao et al., 2024a; Tang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2024). Static sparsity
methods predefine token selection rules, avoiding runtime computation and enabling faster infer-
ence. For instance, StreamLLM (Xiao et al., 2024c) retains sink tokens (early context) and recent
tokens, reducing KV cache size without additional selection overhead.
Dynamic sparsity methods adaptively select representative tokens per generation step, often yielding
higher accuracy but at increased computational cost. They require careful hyperparameter tuning
(e.g., chunk size in InfLLM (Xiao et al., 2024a), or ANN index construction in RetrievalAtten-
tion (Liu et al., 2024)) and must retain the full KV cache as a candidate pool, limiting memory
savings. Although offloading KV caches to the CPU reduces GPU memory usage, it incurs high

retrieval latency (Sun et al., 2024). As a result, dynamic methods demand sophisticated CPU-GPU
coordination (Xiao et al., 2024a; Lee et al., 2024b; He & Zhai, 2024; Liu et al., 2024), increasing
implementation complexity.

Figure 1: The illustration of SAGE-KV with the single-pass KV cache selection . The full KV
cache consists of four parts: initial tokens, tokens for eviction, recent tokens, and the last token. To
construct a reduced KV cache, we select the top-k evicted tokens based on their attention scores with
the last token and concatenate them with the initial and recent tokens. The updated cache is used for
continuous token generation, with each new token (green) added to the recent tokens, updating the
recent window for the next step.
In this paper, we tackle efficient long-context inference in LLMs by leveraging the observation that,
after the pre-filling stage, LLMs naturally focus on critical information. We analyze the sparsity
of the attention score and find that the attention heads selectively highlight important tokens. This
insight motivates our optimization of KV cache compression at the head level. Based on this, we
propose Self-Attention Guided Eviction for KV Cache (SAGE-KV) (Fig. 1), a novel method that
uses attention scores to guide eviction of KV cache, significantly improving inference efficiency
while preserving precision.
SAGE-KV employs a single-pass token-level KV cache selection strategy, compressing the KV
cache once after the pre-filling stage using attention scores (Fig. 1). Only the compressed KV cache
is retained, eliminating redundant KV selection during token generation, unlike block-level dynamic
methods. This reduces computational overhead while preserving essential information for inference.
By retaining only the most relevant tokens, SAGE-KV ensures both efficiency and accuracy. It
combines the fixed sparsity of static methods—benefiting from their single-pass processing and
structured cache—with the context-adaptive selection of dynamic methods. This synergy enables
SAGE-KV to achieve superior efficiency while maintaining or even improving performance over
existing dynamic block-level KV selection approaches.
Extensive experiments across long-context LLMs and benchmarks validate these advantages.
SAGE-KV achieves nearly 4x higher memory efficiency and improved accuracy compared to the
static KV eviction method StreamLLM Xiao et al. (2024c), and 2x higher memory efficiency over
the dynamic block-level KV eviction method Quest Tang et al. (2024). This simple yet effective
approach accelerates long-context inference while remaining easy to integrate, offering a promising
solution to the challenges of long-context LLM inference.
2 S ELF -ATTENTION GUIDED KV C ACHE EVICTION
Given a long input sequence s = [ ti]N
i=1 of length N, consisting of a context followed by a query,
the pre-filling step produces the full key-value cache for layer l: Pl = [( kl
i, vl
i)]N
i=1. As illustrated
in Fig. 1, the proposed method proceeds as follows.
Step 1: Full KV Cache Partition. We divide the KV cache Pl into four parts: (1) initial tokens or
sink tokens Sl = Pl
1:S with length S, (2) evicted tokens El = Pl
S+1:S+E with length E, (3) recent
tokens R = Pl
S+E+1:N −1 with length R = N − 1 − (S + E) and (4) the last token’s KV cache
Pl
N . Sink and recent tokens are retained separately, as attention analysis shows that initial and most
recent tokens typically receive higher attention scores across all heads (Xiao et al., 2024c), which
refers to this as the “attention sink”.

Step 2: Representative Token/KV Cache Selection . We select representative KV cache entries
based on the attention scores between the last token of the input sequence and the evicted tokens.
Let ql ∈ R Hq×dh denote the query vector corresponding to the last token’s KV cache Pl
N , where
Hq is the number of query heads, dh is the head dimension, and Hq × dh = d, the hidden dimen-
sion. In decoder-only LLMs, the last token’s hidden representation often serves as an embedding
for the entire input sequence (Lee et al., 2024a; BehnamGhader et al., 2024). Thus, ql acts as a
representative embedding for the full sequence.
For each layer l, we use ql to select the top-k KV cache entries, El
topk
, based on the attention scores
with El. This yields Hq groups of the top- k KV caches, forming a representative set of key-value
pairs for the next-token generation.
Step 3: Reduced KV Cache Construction . The reduced KV cache C is formed by concatenating
sink token KV cache, selected top-k token KV cache, recent token KV cache as well as the last KV
cache, resulting in C = Concat(S, Etopk , R, Pl
N ) with total length S + k + R + 1.
Step 4: Generation/Decoding. The output is generated using the reduced KV cache C. Each new
token’s KV pair is added to the recent windowR, evicting the oldest entry in R to maintain its size.
This process repeats until generation completes.
3 E XPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
3.1 E XPERIMENTAL SETUP
Benchmarks and long context LLMs . We assess long-context processing with LongBench (Bai
et al., 2023) on tasks like QA, summarization, retrieval, and code analysis. Experiments span
Llama3.1-8B-Instruct (128k)(Dubey et al., 2024), Llama-3-8B-ProLong-512k-Instruct(Gao et al.,
2024), and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (128k) (Hui et al., 2024), ensuring broad model evaluation.
Baselines. We compare our method with the following: (1) Full-Attention Models: which use
standard full attention; (2) Hugging Face StreamLLM (Xiao et al., 2024c): the official implemen-
tation; (3) Our StreamLLM Implementation: which addresses position conflicts1 in the Hugging
Face version by introducing (a) StreamLLM R, which stores pre-RoPE KV cache and applies local
window relative positional encoding, and (b) StreamLLMAbs, which uses absolute positional encod-
ing; (See Appendix) (4) Quest (Tang et al., 2024): a block-wise top- k selection method; and (5)
InfLLM (Xiao et al., 2024a): which integrates sink tokens, recent tokens, and block-wise top- k
selection. See Appendix for SAGE-KV implementation details.

3.2 R ESULTS
Accuracy comparison on LongBench is represented in in Table 1, which shows that:
• SAGE-KV achieves accuracy comparable to full attention by applying self-attention-guided KV
cache selection after pre-filling. Unlike per-token generation based selection, it selects KV entries
in a single pass using the last input token’s attention scores, leveraging LLMs’ inherent ability to
prioritize key tokens for effective answer generation.
• StreamLLM’s static sparse KV selection degrades accuracy in long-context LLMs by discarding
essential information from the middle of the input. Our implementation outperforms the Hugging
Face (HF) version, with significantly better results on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruction and slightly higher
accuracy on Llama3.1-8B-Instruct. The improvement likely stems from a flaw in HF’s RoPE ro-
tation reported in Hugging Face Issue (2024), which misaligns key cache positions and increases
relative token distances, particularly affecting Qwen2.5. Our implementation corrects this, ensuring
more stable performance and underscoring the importance of precise implementation for Stream-
LLM, especially in position-sensitive models.
• Dynamic sparse KV selection methods like InfLLM and Quest retrieve relevant blocks per step but
underperform compared to SAGE-KV. Their block-wise top-k selection, relying on pooled vectors
over blocks, weakens critical token retention (Liu et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024), leading to lower
accuracy (Gao et al., 2024). While block-level selection reduces latency, it struggles to preserve
essential tokens. In contrast, SAGE-KV ’s token-level selection better approximates full attention,
achieving higher accuracy and highlighting the importance of precise token selection for efficient
KV cache management.
Memory efficiency analysis. We evaluate KV cache eviction methods on Llama3.1-8B-Instruct,
measuring average accuracy across eight LongBench tasks (See Appendix) under token budgets B
of 0.5k, 1k, 2k, 4k, and 8k. Results in Fig. 2 reveal the following insights.

(1) Performance improves across all methods as the token
budget increases, indicating better information retention and
higher accuracy.
(2) SAGE-KV consistently outperforms StreamLLM’s static
sparse KV selection across all token budgets by reducing the
significant information loss caused by discarding middle sec-
tions. Instead, SAGE-KV employs a self-attention-guided
top-k token selection strategy, preserving critical information
within the same budget. This demonstrates the effectiveness
of our adaptive KV eviction method.
(3) With a 2k token budget, SAGE-KV achieves the same ac-
curacy as StreamLLM at 8k, improving memory efficiency by
∼4x on LongBench tasks. This highlights the advantage of attention-guided KV eviction in balanc-
ing performance and memory usage.
(4) SAGE-KV achieves ∼2x memory efficiency by matching Quest’s performance with half the
token budget (4k vs. 8k). Unlike Quest’s coarse chunk-level top- k selection, SAGE-KV employs
token-level selection for more precise context retention, leveraging LLMs’ ability to prioritize im-
portant tokens.
4 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We introduce SAGE-KV, an efficient KV cache eviction method for long-context LLM inference.
Exploiting attention sparsity, SAGE-KV compresses the KV cache after prefilling for direct use
in generation. Our experiments show that SAGE-KV matches the inference speed of static sparse
methods while preserving accuracy close to full attention. It achieves∼4x higher memory efficiency
and greater accuracy than the static eviction method StreamLLM, and ∼2x higher memory effi-
ciency with better accuracy than the dynamic method Quest. Additionally, SAGE-KV seamlessly
integrates with popular LLM frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, Meta’s LLaMA,
and Alibaba’s Qwen, ensuring broad applicability.

Future Work. Current long-context tasks mainly involve short outputs, such as question answering
and retrieval. However, for long-text generation, a single top-k selection may be insufficient. Future
work will evaluate our method on long-output benchmarks and introduce interval-based updates,
where the LLM periodically refreshes selected key tokens to improve coherence and relevance.

A.1 S TREAM LLM WITH RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE POSITIONS
Figure 3: Implementation of Absolute and Relative Positioning in StreamLLM. Relative position
assigns indices within StreamLLM’s sliding window, dynamically shifting as the window moves to
maintain a bounded range. In contrast, absolute position assigns a fixed index to each token based
on its original sequence, increasing continuously as new tokens are added.
A.2 I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS OF SAGE-KV WITH LLM S
Hyper-parameter settings. For our method SAGE-KV, suppose that the token budget is B and the
query group number is G = hq/hv where hq and hkv are the query head number and ke/value head
number, respectively, we set the sink window as B/4, and k = B
2G, and the recent window size as
B/4. For Llama3.1-8B-Instruct and Llama-3-8B-ProLong-512k-Instruct, we setB = 8192, and thus
sink window size = 2048 andk = 1024, the local window size = 2048. For Qwen2.5, since the query
group number is 7, we set B = 8192, thus sink window size = 2048, k = 512 and the local window
size = 8192 - 2048 - 7 · 512 = 2560. For other baselines, we set the same token budget B 8192.
Absolute positioning is applied in SAGE-KV to the reduced KV cache to maintain token order.
Task names for token budget analysis . We use the following eight LongBench tasks for hyper-
parameter analysis, as in (Tang et al., 2024): “gov-report”, “multifieldqa-en”, “narrativeqa”,
“passage-retrieval-en”, “qasper”, “repobench-p”, “hotpotqa”, and “triviaqa”.
