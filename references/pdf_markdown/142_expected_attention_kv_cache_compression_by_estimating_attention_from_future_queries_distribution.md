Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck for efficient large
language model (LLM) inference. While attention-score-based KV cache pruning shows promise, it faces
critical practical limitations: attention scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and
modern implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention matrix, making past
scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we introduceExpected Attention, a training-free
compression methodthat estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will
attend to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM activations to compute
expected attention scores in closed form for each KV pair. These scores enable principled ranking
and pruning of KV pairs with minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression
without performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across both prefilling
and decoding phases, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally,
we release KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20 techniques.
1. Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) (Achiam et al., 2023; Anthropic, 2025; MetaAI, 2024; Yang et al.,
2025) have revolutionized text generation and reasoning, enabling advanced applications such as long
multi-round dialogues, extensive multimodal intelligence (Yang et al., 2025; Weng et al., 2024), and
agentic workflows that ingest massive amounts of data (OpenAI, 2024; PerplexityAI, 2025; Yamada
et al., 2025). These applications often require processing extensive contextual information. For example,
processing a large codebase or a short video can easily involve analyzing hundreds of thousands of tokens.
A critical issue in deploying LLMs in such scenarios is the prohibitive memory consumption of the
Key-Value (KV) cache (Fu, 2024; Shi et al., 2024; LI et al., 2025).
During autoregressive generation, the KV cache stores key and value vectors for every processed
token, enabling efficient attention computation. However, its memory footprint grows linearly with
sequence length, quickly becoming the primary bottleneck for long-context inference. A medium-sized
70B model (MetaAI, 2025) requires approximately 320 GB of GPU memory for a one-million-token KV
cache, far exceeding most GPU capacities. This challenge intensifies with emerging applications where
advanced reasoning models generate thousands of intermediate tokens (DeepSeek-AI, 2024b; Yang et al.,
2025) and agentic systems load massive datasets (OpenAI, 2025; PerplexityAI, 2025). While current
LLMs promise extended context lengths up to a million tokens (GeminiTeam, 2025; MetaAI, 2024),
hardware constraints saturate GPU memory well before reaching theoretical limits.
State Space Models offer a solution by reducing memory costs (Gu et al., 2022; Gu & Dao, 2024),
yet their inferior performance compared to transformers, especially on long context tasks, limits adop-
tion (Jelassi et al., 2024; Merrill et al., 2024). Other architectural changes limited to the attention
mechanism, such as multi-head latent attention (DeepSeek-AI, 2024a) or sliding window attention (Jiang
et al., 2023; GemmaTeam, 2025), reduce KV cache size but do not remove the attention bottleneck and
are orthogonal to KV cache compression. Additionally, such methods need to be implemented at training

time, limiting their application to pre-trained modern LLMs. This creates demand for training-free KV
cache compression methods that preserve transformer architectures while mitigating memory growth.
A promising direction for such training-free compression lies in exploiting semantic redundancy
in natural language: not all tokens equally influence future predictions, and many provide negligible
information once their contextual role is fulfilled. This property allows to compress the KV cache by
removing some of the keys and values stored in it. However, determining which tokens can be safely
removed is far from trivial, as any Key-Value (KV) pair’s importance depends on howfuture queries
will attend to it. Existing approaches use heuristics like discarding oldest tokens (Ge et al., 2024; Xiao
et al., 2023) or leverage attention scores from past queries (Zhang et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025; Oren et al.,
2024), but these strategies are limited for real-world scenarios, and often require accessing attention
scores which are not materialized in modern transformer implementations (Dao et al., 2022).
Instead of relying on heuristics or local attention metrics, we argue that a KV pair’s significance
is best measured by its global effect on the transformer’s output. We quantify this effect by isolating
each KV pair’s contribution within the residual stream, capturing its influence on the model output.
This raises the challenge of estimatinghow future queries will attend to each token in the context, which
requires accessing attention scores from the past and from future tokens, that are not available at
the time of compression. To address this, we introduceExpected Attention, which estimates future
attention allocation from distribution of future queries. Expected Attention estimates the importance
that each token in the context has for queries that have not been generated and accordingly prunes the
KV cache up to 60% while preserving performance quality, requiring no architectural modifications or
additional training. We release our code as a comprehensive library benchmarking over 20 state-of-the-art
compression methods.
To summarize, our contributions are the following:
• We analyse the distributional properties of LLM activations through the lenses of KV cache
compression and introduce the concept ofExpected Attentionto estimate the importance that
current tokens will have in the future.
• We introduce a KV cache compression method that leverages Expected Attention and evicts
irrelevant KV pairs for efficient inference.
• We release all our code as a library, designed for researchers, that allows to easily implement, test
and benchmark KV cache compression methods.
2. Expected Attention
2.1. Key-Value Cache in Autoregressive Transformers
We consider decoder-only language models based on the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017),
representing the vast majority of modern LLMs. When an input sequence of tokensx= [𝑥1,𝑥2,...,𝑥𝑡]is
fed to the model, each token𝑥𝑖is transformed into a hidden state representationℎ𝑖∈Rℎand processed
by a stack of transformer layers, including feed forward networks and multi-head attention blocks. For

brevity and clarity, we focus our analysis on a single layer and attention head, noting that the following
analysis naturally extends to multi-head attention, grouped query attention (GQA, Ainslie et al. 2023)
and all their variants.
Let ℎ𝑖∈Rℎdenote the hidden state at position𝑖in the sequence. In the attention block, the
corresponding Query, Key and Value projections are computed as:
𝑞𝑖=𝑅𝑖𝑊𝑄ℎ𝑖, 𝑘𝑖=𝑅𝑖𝑊𝐾ℎ𝑖, 𝑣𝑖=𝑊𝑉ℎ𝑖 (1)
where 𝑑is the attention head dimension,𝑅𝑖∈R𝑑×𝑑is the Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE, Su et al.
2023) matrix at position𝑖, and𝑊𝑄,𝑊𝐾,𝑊𝑉∈Rℎ×𝑑are respectively the learnable projection matrices
for query, key, and value inR𝑑. During autoregressive inference, keys and values vectors are stored in the
KV cache to avoid recomputing them in future generation steps. The resulting KV cache is a collection
of Key-Value pairs(𝑘𝑖,𝑣𝑖)from all inference steps in the sequence, leading to significant computational
savings but increasing memory requirements, growing linearly with sequence length.
At generation step𝑡, the attention mechanism computes the attention score between the current
query𝑞𝑡and each previously cached key𝑘𝑖for𝑖≤𝑡:
𝑎𝑡𝑖=
exp
(︁
𝑞𝑇
𝑡𝑘𝑖√
𝑑
)︁
∑︀𝑡
𝑗=1exp
(︁
𝑞𝑇
𝑡𝑘𝑗√
𝑑
)︁= 𝑧𝑡𝑖
∑︀𝑡
𝑗=1𝑧𝑡𝑗
(2)
where 𝑎𝑡𝑖is the normalized attention score between query at position𝑡and key at position𝑖, and
𝑧𝑡𝑖= exp
(︁
𝑞𝑇
𝑡𝑘𝑖√
𝑑
)︁
represents the unnormalized attention score.
The attention score is used to weight and sum over all values previously stored in the KV cache. The
resulting output is then added to the hidden stateℎ𝑡:
ℎout
𝑡 =ℎ𝑡+
𝑡∑︁
𝑖=1
𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑊𝑜𝑣𝑖=ℎ𝑡+
𝑡∑︁
𝑖=1
Δℎ𝑡𝑖 (3)
whereℎ𝑡∈Rℎandℎout
𝑡∈Rℎrepresent the hidden state before and after the attention update respectively,
and 𝑊𝑜∈R𝑑×ℎis the learnable output projection matrix. The hidden states embeddingℎ𝑡represents
the "residual stream," (Elhage et al., 2021) updated via vector additions by each transformer block.
The valueΔ ℎ𝑡𝑖= 𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑊𝑜𝑣𝑖isolates the specific residual addition of the𝑖-th KV pair at step𝑡. This
decomposition reveals that each cached KV pair(𝑘𝑖,𝑣𝑖)contributes a residual updateΔ ℎ𝑡𝑖to the final
output, and provides a natural measure of the importance of each KV pair:
‖Δℎ𝑡𝑖‖=𝑎𝑡𝑖‖𝑊𝑜𝑣𝑖‖(4)
where‖·‖denotes the L2 norm. This metric captures both the attention weight𝑎𝑡𝑖(how much the query
attends to the𝑖-th key) and the transformed value magnitude‖𝑊𝑜𝑣𝑖‖(the impact of the𝑖-th value on
the output). Equation 4 provides the optimal measure for estimating the impact of each KV pair in the
model output. If we could compute this score for all cached KV pairs, we could selectively prune the
cache by removing pairs with the lowest impact, thereby minimizing performance degradation. However,
computing Equation 4 presents significant practical challenges. While‖𝑊𝑜𝑣𝑖‖is readily available at
inference time, the attention weight𝑎𝑡𝑖depends on future queries that have not yet been generated.
Specifically, we cannot know the attention scores from future tokens𝑡+ 1,𝑡+ 2,...before computing
them, making it impossible to predict which KV pairs will be important for upcoming generation
steps. Furthermore, modern transformer implementations utilize Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao,
2024), which computes attention scores on-the-fly without materializing the complete attention matrix,
preventing access to even past attention scores. To address these fundamental limitations, we leverage
the properties of activations in modern LLMs, and introduceExpected Attention.
2.2. Expected Attention: Estimating Attention From Future Queries
Distributional properties of LLM activationsTo approximate the unnormalized attention score

follow a Gaussian distributionℎ∼𝒩(𝜇,Σ). While we show an example of this property in Figure 1, we
also extensively validate it across multiple model architectures in Section B. Given this distributional
assumption, queries also inherit Gaussian properties through the linear transformation in Equation 1

where𝜇∈R𝑑andΣ ∈R𝑑×𝑑are the mean and covariance of the hidden state distribution, and𝑅𝑡∈R𝑑×𝑑
is the RoPE matrix at position𝑡.
To create a single, tractable representation of attention over a future interval, we approximate
the positional embeddings by averaging the RoPE matrix over the next𝑇positions. This gives us a
position-averaged query distribution:

Expected Attention ScoreWith this query distribution, we can now analytically compute the
expected unnormalized attention score in Equation 2. For a query¯𝑞∼𝒩(¯𝜇𝑞, ¯Σ𝑞)in our interval𝑇and a
fixed key𝑘𝑖, the expected unnormalized score for that key is:

where the second equality follows from the moment-generating function of a Gaussian distribution. We
then define the expected attention score by applying the softmax on our unnormalized expectation:
^𝑎𝑖= ^𝑧𝑖
∑︀𝑡
𝑗=1^𝑧𝑗
(8)
With this approximation, we can now estimate the importance of each cached KV pair. We define the
expected contribution magnitude by substituting our expected attention weight into the contribution
score formula from Equation 4:
‖̂︁Δℎ𝑖‖= (^𝑎𝑖+𝜖)‖𝑊𝑜𝑣𝑖‖(9)
where ^𝑎𝑖is the expected attention weight from Equation 8,‖𝑊𝑜𝑣𝑖‖ ∈Ris the magnitude of the
transformed value vector, and𝜖is a small hyperparameter. This metric provides a tractable approximation
to the true contribution score without requiring future queries.
Compression with Expected AttentionEquation 9 captures the contribution of each KV pair
to the transformer output. The Expected Attention compression algorithm scores all cached KV pairs
according to Equation 9 and evicts the𝑟%pairs with the lowest expected contributions, where𝑟∈[0, 1]
is the compression ratio. Intuitively, this is equivalent to removing those KV pairs that have the smallest
impact on the residual stream and therefore on the model output. We provide pseudo-code for our
compression algorithm in Listing 1.

x-axis represents the compression ratio, the y-axis the score for each specific dataset. The horizontal line
represents the baseline performance without cache compression. Expected Attention achieves optimal
trade-off between compression ratio and scores across most datasets (Additional and averaged results in
Section D).
Head-Adaptive CompressionPrevious work has shown that different attention heads serve different
roles in the model. We adopt adaptive per-layer compression (Feng et al., 2024) to account for this
heterogeneity, allowing more important heads to retain more KV pairs.
3. Experiments
3.1. Experimental Setup
Prefilling vs Decoding GenerationLLM inference comprises two phases with distinct computational
characteristics. Theprefilling phaseprocesses the entire input prompt in parallel, computing key-value
projections for the KV cache, a compute-bound operation requiring substantial floating-point operations.
Thedecoding phasesequentially generates tokens using the KV cache and previous logits, appending
new key-value pairs iteratively (Deepak & Amr, 2024; Gordić, 2025). This dichotomy has motivated
disaggregated architectures that implement prefill and decoding on different hardware, at the cost of
transferring the cache, further incentivising compression (Deepak Patil, 2024; StepFun et al., 2025).
Therefore, an effective compression method must perform well in both prefilling and decoding (Deepak
& Amr, 2024; Gordić, 2025). Nevertheless, a number of recent methods often target a single phase:
SnapKV (Li et al., 2025) for prefilling via query attention scores, StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) and
KNorm (Devoto et al., 2024) for streaming decoding. Expected Attention is designed considering these
two aspects of LLM inference and addresses both scenarios efficiently. We present results for prefilling
and decoding in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 respectively.
Models and DatasetsFor prefilling (one-shot compression before generation), we test three model
families supporting long contexts: Llama3.1-8B (128k) (MetaAI, 2025), Qwen3-8B (32k) (Yang et al.,
2025), and Gemma3-12B (128k) (GemmaTeam, 2025), all instruction-tuned. For decoding (compression
during generation), we analyse reasoning models that generate extensive intermediate reasoning tokens

Our benchmarks include LongBench (Bai et al., 2024), Ruler (Hsieh et al., 2024), and Needle in
a Haystack (Kamradt, 2023; Liu et al., 2024) for prefilling, and Aime25 (Balunović et al., 2025) and
MATH-500 (Lightman et al., 2023) for decoding.
BaselinesFollowing an initial benchmarking study on Ruler (see Section D), we selected and compare
our method against the best-performing baselines for each use case. For prefilling, we evaluate attention-
based approaches like SnapKV (Li et al., 2025) and TOVA (Oren et al., 2024), embedding-based
KeyDiff (Park et al., 2025), and the trainable DuoAttention (Xiao et al., 2024) when the checkpoint
is available. SnapKV (Li et al., 2025) and TOVA (Oren et al., 2024) rank KV pairs using attention
scores from user queries. KeyDiff (Park et al., 2025) employs distance metrics between key embeddings
for selection, making it also suitable for decoding generation. DuoAttention (Xiao et al., 2024) takes
a trainable approach, learning compression masks for each attention head. For decoding, we focus
on methods designed to be compatible with streaming generation: KNorm (Devoto et al., 2024),
StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023), and KeyDiff (Park et al., 2025). KNorm (Devoto et al., 2024) uses
a simple approach by preserving keys with the lowest𝐿2 norm. StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023)
maintains initial sink tokens throughout generation.
Implementation detailsWe implement Expected Attention in Pytorch (Paszke et al., 2019). For all
benchmarks, we test the models on 8 H100 GPUs, with batch size 1. We make all the code to reproduce
our method and the baselines available in KVPress. In all experiments we use𝜖= 0.02, except for needle
in a haystack where use𝜖= 0, and we average the RoPE embeddings over the next𝑇= 512positions.
For prefilling, we do not assume any question about the context. This simulates a real world use case
and avoids favouring methods like SnapKV that rely on this assumption. For decoding, we keep a small
buffer of hidden states of 128 tokens to compute statistics, and perform compression every 512 generation
steps. In Equation 9 we only use𝑉instead of𝑊𝑜𝑉, as using𝑊𝑜leads to a minor increase in results at
a significantly higher memory cost.

synthetic tasks, and code completion. As shown in Figure 2 for Llama3.1-8B and Qwen3-8B (see
Section D for Gemma3-12B), Expected Attention consistently achieves optimal compression-performance
trade-offs, maintaining higher scores across all compression ratios. This demonstrates effective retention
of critical KV pairs even under significant compression across varied reasoning and generation tasks.
RulerRuler (Hsieh et al., 2024) measures retrieval, multi-hop tracing, and aggregation abilities within
long contexts through four subsets: NIAH (Needle-in-a-Haystack) for single-fact retrieval, VT (Variable
Tracking) for multi-hop reasoning, CWE (Common Words Extraction) for frequency-based aggregation,
and FWE (Frequent Words Extraction) for statistical pattern recognition. Table 1 shows results at
various compression ratios for 4k and 16k windows. Expected Attention maintains strong performance
across all subsets, particularly at higher compression ratios. While KeyDiff performs well on Llama3.1-8B,
it struggles on Gemma3-12B and Qwen3-8B, potentially due to QK normalization (GemmaTeam, 2025;
Yang et al., 2025). Our Expected Attention-based policy effectively preserves information necessary for
precise retrieval tasks.
Needle in a HaystackThe NIAH test (Kamradt, 2023) embeds specific information (the "needle")
within lengthy distracting text (the "haystack") to evaluate retrieval capabilities across varying context
positions and lengths. The test systematically varies both the needle’s position within the context
(needle depth) and the total context length to assess consistent retrieval performance. Figure 3 visualizes
retrieval success across needle positions and context lengths up to 125k tokens. Expected Attention
demonstrates robust performance comparable to DuoAttention and significantly more stable than other
baselines in long contexts, confirming retention of critical information under compression regardless of
needle placement or context size.
4.2. Decoding
For decoding, we evaluate Expected Attention on reasoning models, Qwen-15B-R1, Qwen-7B-R1, and
OpenMath-Nemotron-14B. Reasoning models are particularly suitable for our evaluation as they generate
extensive chain-of-thought outputs for reasoning traces, placing significant demands on KV cache
memory (Łańcucki et al., 2025). We use the Aime25 (Yamada et al., 2025) and MATH-500 (Lightman
et al., 2023) datasets. Aime25 consists of competition-level mathematical problems requiring multi-step
reasoning and precise calculation, while MATH-500 encompasses diverse mathematical domains with
varying difficulty levels. During decoding, we allow the KV cache to expand to a predetermined size
before initiating token eviction. In the tables, we use𝑛×to show that the final cache size is𝑛times
smaller than would be without compression.
Results for Aime25 and MATH-500 are presented in Figure 4 and Table 2, respectively. Expected
Attention consistently outperforms or matches baseline methods across all models, with particularly
strong performance at higher compression ratios (4×and16×). Most methods demonstrate minimal
performance degradation at2×compression, indicating that a large portion of tokens in reasoning

traces contains redundant information that can be pruned without affecting mathematical reasoning
performance. Expected Attention shows the best performance especially in high-compression scenarios
(12×compression).
4.3. Memory Savings and Efficiency
We evaluate the memory efficiency of our method using Llama3.1-8B and Qwen3-8B for both prefilling
and decoding phases. All experiments are conducted on a single H100 GPU with bfloat16 precision for
both model weights and KV cache. We focus on peak memory usage as the primary efficiency metric, as
KV cache memory consumption is often the primary bottleneck for long-context inference.
Figure 5a demonstrates peak memory usage as sequence length increases up to 120k tokens, comparing
Expected Attention at 50% and 90% compression ratios against the uncompressed baseline with vanilla
attention. The results show that memory savings become increasingly substantial as context length
grows.
Figure 5b illustrates the relationship between compression ratio (x-axis) and NIAH benchmark
performance for Qwen3-8B, with marker size representing the corresponding KV cache size. While higher
compression ratios naturally reduce KV cache size, they typically incur performance penalties. Remark-
ably, Expected Attention at 50% compression maintains performance parity with the uncompressed
baseline while achieving a2×reduction in KV cache size, demonstrating an optimal balance between
memory efficiency and task performance.

5. KVPress: A Research Framework for KV Cache Compression
We introduceKVPress, a comprehensive PyTorch-based library designed to streamline the development
and benchmarking of KV cache compression methods. By natively integrating with Hugging Face
transformers (Wolf et al., 2020), KVPress allows researchers to implement and test novel techniques
rapidly and intuitively.
KVPress achieves this integration by utilizing PyTorch forward hooks attached to each attention
layer. This design choice allows the framework to operate entirely within the existing Hugging Face
transformer pipeline, eliminating the need to modify the model architecture or implement a custom,
low-level KV cache management system. Specifically, after each attention layer’s forward pass, the hook
is triggered to calculate the importance scores for the current KV pairs. Based on a chosen compression
policy (e.g., Expected Attention), the hook then selectively evicts the KV pairs with the lowest scores
before the model proceeds to the next layer. This non-invasive, layer-by-layer compression mechanism
significantly simplifies the experimentation process for researchers. KVPress currently incorporates over
20 existing state-of-the-art compression techniques, including post-training and trainable ones. Our
primary goal is to establish a shared, standardized platform that accelerates research and ensures fair,
reproducible benchmarking within theKVCache compression field.
It is important to note that KVPress is not an optimized engine for deployment. This choice to
prioritize readability over runtime efficiency facilitates the design of standard implementations and
consistent benchmarking. We believe production-level efficiency is best achieved through subsequent,
low-level optimization of individual methods, which would otherwise complicate the framework’s primary
role as a unified research tool.
5.1. KVPress Leaderboard and Standardized Benchmarking
To complement the framework, we provide a publicKVPress leaderboardfor standardized evaluation
across multiple long-context benchmarks. The leaderboard establishes consistent evaluation protocols,
enabling direct and reproducible comparison of new compression methods against existing approaches.
We hope that this framework, alongside its standardized benchmarking suite, will support the research
community’s efforts to develop and validate novel compression techniques for long-context language
models.
6. Related Works
Trainable KV-Cache CompressionOne approach to reducing memory requirements involves
modifying the model architecture or training procedure to inherently produce smaller caches. Ainslie et al.
(2023); Shazeer (2019) reduce cache size by decreasing the number of key-value heads, effectively sharing
key-value representations across queries. DeepSeek-V2 (DeepSeek-AI, 2024b) introduced Multi-Head
Latent Attention, which projects keys and values into a lower-dimensional latent space during training,
directly reducing the memory footprint of cached representations. Alternative trainable approaches focus
on learning compression policies (Łańcucki et al., 2025; Nawrot et al., 2024) or masks (Xiao et al., 2024)
from pre-trained checkpoints. Finally, State Space Models (Gu et al., 2022; Gu & Dao, 2024) replace the
quadratic attention mechanism with linear-complexity alternatives, while hybrid approaches combine
transformer layers with RNN-based components (Ren et al., 2025; Glorioso et al., 2024). Although
these trainable methods typically achieve superior performance, they require substantial computational
resources for pre-training or continued pre-training, making them less practical for deployment with
existing large-scale models.
Training-Free KV cache compressionGiven the computational costs associated with trainable
methods, significant research effort has focused on developing post-training compression techniques that
can be applied to existing models without modification. Early approaches (Li et al., 2025; Oren et al.,
2024) directly utilize attention scores to rank KV pairs by importance. However, these methods require
access to the full attention matrix, making them incompatible with Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022)
and thus impractical for modern deployment scenarios. To address this limitation, several works have
9

<!-- page 10 -->

Expected Attention:
KV Cache Compression by Estimating Attention from Future Queries Distribution
developed heuristic-based importance measures that can be computed without materializing attention
matrices, such as keys norm (KNorm Devoto et al. (2024)), token positions (StreamingLLM Xiao et al.
(2023), H2O Zhang et al. (2024)) or SVD projection (Q-Filters Godey et al. (2025)). Recognizing that
different attention heads exhibit varying sensitivity to compression, recent methods such as AdaKV (Feng
et al., 2024) and PyramidKV (Cai et al., 2025a) adopt head-specific compression strategies.Expected
Attention, adopts insights from these heuristic approaches while providing a principled theoretical
foundation based on the distributional properties of transformer activations.
QuantizationInstead of reducing the KV cache size along the sequence dimension, quantization
methods try to reduce the precision used to store the cache. For example, NQKV Cai et al. (2025b)
partitions the cache into blocks for quantization and processes them separately. KVQuant (Hooper et al.,
2024) performs non uniform per-layer quantization, while KIVI (Zirui Liu et al., 2023) quantizes the key
cache by layer and the value cache by token. These methods are orthogonal to Expected Attention (and
to KV cache compression in general), making it possible to integrate them.
Efficient ImplementationsAlongside compression, sparse attention and quantization, another effort
has been done to devise efficient implementation of inference systems. In this context, a well designed
low-level handling of the KV cache can deliver significant performance speed-ups, especially in multi-user
serving systems. The first to investigate this and introduce efficient memory management for KV cache
was vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023), soon followed by other approaches (Prabhu et al., 2024; Jiang et al.,
2024) and frameworks (NVIDIA, 2024).
7. Limitations
A key trade-off of our training-free methodology is that its performance does not match that of trainable
methods (DeepSeek-AI, 2024a; Łańcucki et al., 2025). This is an intentional design choice that allows
deployment without significant computational resources required for intensive training. Future work
could explore combining our theoretical framework with lightweight fine-tuning.
Another limitation is that our method requires users to specify compression ratios manually, lacking
an automated mechanism to determine optimal compression levels for different scenarios such as text
generation. This represents a promising area for future research.
Finally, whileourPyTorchimplementationeffectivelydemonstratesourmethod’stheoreticalprinciples,
it is not optimized for efficiency. A highly performant implementation with custom CUDA kernels would
significantly improve speed and practical utility.
8. Conclusion
We introduced Expected Attention, a training-free algorithm for KV cache compression. We showed
Expected Attention outperforms state-of-art KV cache compression methods on several benchmarks
and in both prefilling and decoding scenarios. Additionally, we released a research library that allows
researchers to easily implement and experiment with KV cache compression methods, and evaluate them
on popular benchmarks for long context.

Figure 6|Reconstruction error‖ℎ−ℎcompr‖
averaged across model layers. Expected Attention achieves the best error, minimizing the impact on the
residual stream.
A. Reconstruction Error Across Methods
In Section 2, we discussed the challenge of compressing the KV cache without significantly altering the
residual stream. To understand the impact of Expected Attention on the model output, we quantify the
reconstruction error of the residual stream, i.e. how the difference between the original, uncompressed
hidden states and the corresponding hidden states after compression. We define the reconstruction error
as‖ℎ−ℎcompr‖, whereℎis the original hidden state without compression andℎcompr the hidden state
after the KV cache has been compressed. We average the reconstrcution error over a long sequence of
∼5K tokens and display the results for several methods in Figure 6. Expected Attention consistently
achieves a lower reconstruction error, indicating that it preserves the integrity of the hidden state
more effectively than competing methods, a crucial property for maintaining downstream performance
(Mudarisov et al., 2025; Gordić, 2025).
B. Distributional Properties of LLM activations
In this section, we analyse the distributional properties of activations within Large Language Models. Our
investigation aligns with the findings of prior work, which has demonstrated that LLM activations often
exhibit normal distributions. More specifically Liu et al. (2025) finds that hidden states are zero-mean
unimodal, and qualitatively fall into two distinctly shaped distributions. The hidden states before the
Attention and the MLP layers tend to be Gaussian-like, while the hidden states in the intermediate of
such layers tend to be Laplacian-like.
For Expected Attention, we are interested in the hidden states before the MLP layers and the
corresponding queries. Our study confirms that such activations are predominantly unimodal and can
be approximated as Gaussian distributions, albeit with the presence of a few heavy-tailed outliers, as
already found in Xiao et al. (2023); Sun et al. (2024). In Figure 9a, Figure 8a, and Figure 7a we show
hidden states and queries for different models. For our method, the distributional properties of queries
are of particular importance, and we observe that queries maintain a clear Gaussian-like behaviour. This
also applies to models with QK normalization, where the query projection is not guaranteed to be linear.
The concentration of these activations around a central value and their Gaussian like shape provides the
theoretical basis for Expected Attention.
We stress that in this work, our goal is not to explain or investigate this property, but rather to
leverage it for KV cache compression.
C. Expected Attention Score
To empirically validate that the expected attention score is strongly correlated to the real model attention
score, we plot the correlation between the observed attention and the expected attention score across
different layers and heads. We use sequence of 5K tokens and use the first 1K tokens to compute the
query statistics. We display the results in Figure 10. We see that for different layers and attention heads,
the expected attention score from Equation 4 is strongly correlated to the original attention score.

D. Additional Results
In Table 3 we show additional results on the LongBench dataset, averaged across all subsets.
RulerIn order to select the most competitive baselines we performed an initial search on 15+ methods
on Ruler. We selected the best performing ones as displayed in Figure 11. We did not include KVZip (Kim
et al., 2025) despite achieving a high score as it needs two forward passes, therefore implying a higher
cost FLOPs that is double as much as the other baselines.
