============================================================
Phase 16: SST-2 Signal Check
============================================================

GOAL: Validate bridge can transmit ANY information
  - Task: Binary sentiment classification
  - Success: Accuracy > 50% (random chance)
  - Target: Accuracy > 80% (bridge works)

WHY SST-2:
  - 67,000 training examples (10x more than GSM8K)
  - Binary classification (simpler than math)
  - 'Blurriness' acceptable (unlike exact numbers)

Training: 2000 steps, batch=16
VQ weight: 0.25
