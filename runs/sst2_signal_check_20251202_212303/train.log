============================================================
Phase 16: SST-2 Signal Check (CONTINUOUS VERSION)
============================================================

GOAL: Validate bridge can transmit ANY information
  - Task: Binary sentiment classification
  - Success: Accuracy > 50% (random chance)
  - Target: Accuracy > 80% (bridge works)

WHY SST-2:
  - 67,000 training examples (10x more than GSM8K)
  - Binary classification (simpler than math)
  - 'Blurriness' acceptable (unlike exact numbers)

WHY CONTINUOUS (not VQ):
  - VQ collapsed in 7 attempts (perplexity → 1)
  - Continuous soft tokens + batch diversity loss
  - RMS normalization prevents saturation

Training: 2000 steps, batch=16
Diversity weight: 0.1

KEY METRICS:
  - Accuracy > 50%: Bridge transmits SOME info
  - Accuracy > 80%: Bridge works well
  - Accuracy ~ 50%: Bridge is broken
  - Batch Div Loss should be LOW (unique outputs)
  - Z Variance should be NON-ZERO
[rank0]:[W1202 21:40:33.475992239 ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:1250] Warning: WARNING: process group has NOT been destroyed before we destruct ProcessGroupNCCL. On normal program exit, the application should call destroy_process_group to ensure that any pending NCCL operations have finished in this process. In rare cases this process can exit before this point and block the progress of another member of the process group. This constraint has always been present,  but this warning has only been added since PyTorch 2.4 (function operator())
