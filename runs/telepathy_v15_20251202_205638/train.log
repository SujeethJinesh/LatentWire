Phase 15: Continuous Telepathy (No Quantization)
======================================================================

WHY CONTINUOUS INSTEAD OF DISCRETE:
  - VQ collapsed to 1 code despite entropy bonus
  - FSQ 8-dim collapsed to div=0
  - FSQ 32-dim collapsed to div=0
  - FSQ + diversity loss collapsed to div=0
  - FSQ + variance loss collapsed to z_var=0
  -> 6 discrete attempts ALL COLLAPSED

CONTINUOUS ARCHITECTURE:
  - Perceiver resampler: compress to 128 soft tokens
  - NO quantization (continuous values)
  - RMS normalization for output scaling
  - BATCH DIVERSITY LOSS to prevent mode collapse
  - 1-step inference

Training: 3000 steps, batch=2
Diversity weight: 0.1
