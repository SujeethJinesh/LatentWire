Phase 10 Evaluation: Auto-Encoder Test (FIXED)
======================================================================
FIX: Added BOS token (Attention Sink) + Explicit Attention Mask

Success Criteria:
  - Output has input entities → Bridge is working!
  - Output is coherent but generic → Teacher Forcing Shortcut
  - Output is empty/garbage → Model collapsed
