Starting from v4.46, the `logits` model output will have the same type as the model (except at train time, where it will always be FP32)
We detected that you are passing `past_key_values` as a tuple of tuples. This is deprecated and will be removed in v4.47. Please convert your cache or use an appropriate `Cache` class (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/kv_cache#legacy-cache-format)
