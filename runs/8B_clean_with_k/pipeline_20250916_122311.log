torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 16.73 GiB. GPU 1 has a total capacity of 79.19 GiB of which 14.85 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 64.33 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 62.44 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 1.23 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
