Phase 12 Evaluation: Diffusion-Generated Soft Tokens
======================================================================
Checkpoint: runs/telepathy_v12_20251130_185036/bridge_v12_final_ema.pt
Diffusion steps: 10

CRITICAL: Using bridge.generate() (ODE solver)
NOT bridge.forward() (velocity prediction)

Success Criteria:
  - Outputs VARY per input (not all identical)
  - Outputs contain question entities (Janet, ducks, numbers)
  - Entity transfer rate > 30% = Success!
