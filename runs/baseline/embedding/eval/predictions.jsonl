{"prompt_raw": "Context: In cpDNA, there are several A \u2192 G deamination gradients. DNA becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded. When replication forks form, the strand not being copied is single stranded, and thus at risk for A \u2192 G deamination. Therefore, gradients in deamination indicate that replication forks were most likely present and the direction that they initially opened (the highest gradient is most likely nearest the start site because it was single stranded for the longest amount of time). This mechanism is still the leading theory today; however, a second theory suggests that most cpDNA is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination. It further contends that only a minority of the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes while the rest is in branched, linear, or other complex structures.\nQuestion: How does the secondary theory say most cpDNA is structured?\n", "gold": "linear", "chat_prompts": {"llama": "<|system|>\nYou are a concise QA assistant.

{"prompt_raw": "Context: Almost all ctenophores are predators \u2013 there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic. If food is plentiful, they can eat 10 times their own weight per day.
