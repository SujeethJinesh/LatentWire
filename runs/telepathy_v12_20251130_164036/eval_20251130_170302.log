Phase 12 Evaluation: Diffusion-Generated Soft Tokens
======================================================================
Checkpoint: runs/telepathy_v12_20251130_164036/bridge_v12_final_ema.pt
Diffusion steps: 10

CRITICAL: Using bridge.generate() (ODE solver)
NOT bridge.forward() (velocity prediction)

Success Criteria:
  - Outputs VARY per input (not all identical)
  - Outputs contain question entities (Janet, ducks, numbers)
  - Entity transfer rate > 30% = Success!

PHASE 12 EVALUATION SUMMARY
======================================================================
Answer Accuracy: 0/20 (0.0%)
Numbers: 4/56 matched (7.1%)
Names: 2/59 matched (3.4%)

OVERALL ENTITY TRANSFER: 6/115 (5.2%)

OUTPUT DIVERSITY: 20/20 unique (100.0%)

======================================================================
LOW ENTITY TRANSFER but diverse outputs.
Bridge generates varied vectors but wrong content.
May need different conditioning (cross-attention vs pooling).
