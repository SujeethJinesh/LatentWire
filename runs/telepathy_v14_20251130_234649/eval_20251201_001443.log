Phase 14 Evaluation: Hybrid Conditioning Diffusion
======================================================================
Checkpoint: runs/telepathy_v14_20251130_234649/bridge_v14_final_ema.pt
Diffusion steps: 10

V13 FAILED because:
  - Pure cross-attention was too weak
  - Model collapsed to repetitive outputs

V14 FIX:
  - Global pooling (strong guide rail)
  - Cross-attention (entity details)

Success Criteria:
  - Flow Loss should have converged (check train.log)
  - Outputs should NOT be repetitive
  - Entity transfer rate > 30%
