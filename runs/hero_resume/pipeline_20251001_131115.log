=== Resume Hero Stage B Training (Schedule Fix) ===
Run tag: hero_resume
Resuming from checkpoint: runs/hero/ckpt_stageb
Saving to: runs/hero_resume/ckpt_stageb
Epochs: 8 (extended for consolidation)

SCHEDULE FIXES (based on v1 analysis):
  - LATENT_KEEP_END: 1.0 → 0.85 (freeze at sweet spot)
  - EPOCHS extended to 8 (consolidate with frozen dropout)
  - Peak checkpointing: train.py saves '_best' automatically

Analysis showed peak at keep_prob=0.6-0.85:
  - Peak: 19.4% first_acc at keep_prob=0.613
  - 26 steps achieved ≥10% (all at keep_prob 0.55-0.82)
  - Final eval (keep_prob=1.0) only 4.4% - model never learned full latents

Retained from v1:
  - FIRST_TOKEN_CE_WEIGHT=11.0
  - KD_WEIGHT=0.5
  - OOM fixes: expandable_segments, KD_TEACHER_CHUNK=1
  - Performance: TEXT_TEACHER_CHUNK=4
