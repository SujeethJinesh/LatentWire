However, this is not necessarily true. While having enough money to meet your basic needs and live comfortably can improve your overall well-being, having more money beyond that point does not guarantee happiness. Research shows that beyond a certain point, an increase in income and wealth does not bring a corresponding increase in happiness or life satisfaction. Therefore, it is important to recognize that money is a tool, and it is how we use it, rather than how much we have, that truly matters.",
