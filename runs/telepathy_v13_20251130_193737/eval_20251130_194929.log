Phase 13 Evaluation: High-Fidelity Cross-Attention Diffusion
======================================================================
Checkpoint: runs/telepathy_v13_20251130_193737/bridge_v13_final_ema.pt
Diffusion steps: 10

KEY CHANGES from V12:
  1. Full cross-attention to Llama sequence (no pooling)
  2. Bridge trained on Question reconstruction

Success Criteria:
  - Outputs VARY per input (not all identical)
  - Outputs contain question entities (Janet, ducks, numbers)
  - Entity transfer rate > 30% = Success!
