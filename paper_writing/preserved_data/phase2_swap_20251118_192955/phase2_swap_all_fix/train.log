Q: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
A: There are 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $<<0.50*12=6>>6 for the cans.
There are 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.50*4=6>>6 for the newspapers.
Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $<<6+6=12>>12.

Q: Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?
A: Matthew picked 16 + 20 = <<16+20=36>>36 strawberries.
Natalie picked 36/2 = <<36/2=18>>18 strawberries.
All together, they have 16 + 36 + 18 = <<16+36+18=70>>70 strawberries.
They can make 70/7 = <<70/7=10>>10 jars of strawberries.
They earn 10 x $4 = $<<10*4=40>>40 from the strawberries they picked.

Q: James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?
A: James starts with 500 Legos and uses half of them, leaving 500/2=<<500/2=250>>250 Legos unused.
He puts those unused Legos away but since he's missing 5 he only puts 250-5=<<250-5=245>>245 Legos away.

Q: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
A: For the first year, Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = $<<1000+100*12=2200>>2200.
The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = $<<2200*10*.01=220>>220.
The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $<<2200+220=2420>>2420.
For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = $<<2420+100*12=3620>>3620.
The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = $<<3620*10*.01=362>>362.
Therefore, Joseph's investment in the mutual fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $<<3620+362=3982>>3982.

Q: The price of buying a wooden toy at the new Craftee And Best store is $20, and the cost of buying a hat is $10. If Kendra went to the shop with a $100 bill and bought two wooden toys and three hats, calculate the change she received.
A: When Kendra bought 2 toys, she paid 2*$20 = $<<2*20=40>>40
Since the price of a hat is $10, when Kendra bought 3 hats, she paid 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
The total costs for the hats and wooden toys Kendra bought is $40+$30 = $<<40+30=70>>70
From the $100 bill, Kendra received change worth $100-$70 =$<<100-70=30>>30

Q: Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?
A: Let's think step by step.

Answer:
Gold answer: 18
Source-alone (extracted): 18
Source-alone full output:
Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and bakes 4 eggs for muffins, so she uses 3+4=7 eggs.
She lays 16 eggs per day, so she has 16-7=9 eggs left to sell.
She sells 9 eggs for $2 each, so she makes 9*2=$18.

Q: A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day. They sell whole wheat bread for $2.50 per loaf and white bread for $1.75 per loaf. If they make a 10% profit on the sale of each loaf, how much profit do they make in a day?
A: The bakery sells 250 loaves of whole wheat bread for $2.50 each, so they make 250*2.50=$625.
The bakery sells 250 loaves of white bread for $1.75 each, so they make 250*1.75=$437.50.
The bakery makes a total of $625+$437.50=$1062.50.
The bakery makes a 10% profit on each loaf, so they make a 10% profit on 250 loaves of whole wheat bread, which is 250*.10=$
Target-alone (extracted): 18

1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
2. She eats 3 for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = <<16-3=13>>13 eggs left.
3. She bakes 4 muffins, so she has 13 - 4 = <<13-4=9>>9 eggs left.
4. She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, so she makes 9 * $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 per day.

Final answer: Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market.

Q: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
A: For the first year, Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = $<<1000+100*12=2200>>2200.
The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = $<<2200*10*.01=220>>220.
The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $<<2200+220=2420>>2420.
For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = $<<2420+100*12=3620>>3620.
The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = $<<3620*10*.01=362>>362.
Therefore, Joseph's investment in the mutual fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $<<3620+362=3982>>3982.

Q: The price of buying a wooden toy at the new Craftee And Best store is $20, and the cost of buying a hat is $10. If Kendra went to the shop with a $100 bill and bought two wooden toys and three hats, calculate the change she received.
A: When Kendra bought 2 toys, she paid 2*$20 = $<<2*20=40>>40
Since the price of a hat is $10, when Kendra bought 3 hats, she paid 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
The total costs for the hats and wooden toys Kendra bought is $40+$30 = $<<40+30=70>>70
From the $100 bill, Kendra received change worth $100-$70 =$<<100-70=30>>30

Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
A: Let's think step by step.

Answer:
Gold answer: 70000
Source-alone (extracted): 195000
Source-alone full output:
Josh spent $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the house.
The house increased in value by 150%, so the new value is 130,000 + (130,000 * 1.5) = 130,000 + 195,000 = $<<130000+195000=325000>>325,000.
Josh made a profit of $325,000 - $130,000 = $<<325000-130000=195000>>195,000.

#### 125
Target-alone (extracted): 12000
Target-alone full output:
1. The initial value of the house is $80,000.
2. After repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%.
3. To find the new value of the house, we multiply the initial value by 1.15 (150% as a decimal).
4. The new value of the house is $80,000 * 1.15 = $<<80000*1.15=92000>>92,000.
5. The profit Josh made is the difference between the new value and the initial value, which is $92,000 - $80,000 = $<<92000-80000=12000>>12,000.

Q: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
A: There are 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $<<0.50*12=6>>6 for the cans.
There are 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.50*4=6>>6 for the newspapers.
Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $<<6+6=12>>12.

Q: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
A: For the first year, Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = $<<1000+100*12=2200>>2200.
The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = $<<2200*10*.01=220>>220.
The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $<<2200+220=2420>>2420.
For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = $<<2420+100*12=3620>>3620.
The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = $<<3620*10*.01=362>>362.
Therefore, Joseph's investment in the mutual fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $<<3620+362=3982>>3982.

Q: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
A: For the first year, Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = $<<1000+100*12=2200>>2200.
The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = $<<2200*10*.01=220>>220.
The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $<<2200+220=2420>>2420.
For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = $<<2420+100*12=3620>>3620.
The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = $<<3620*10*.01=362>>362.
Therefore, Joseph's investment in the mutual fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $<<3620+362=3982>>3982.

Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
A: Let's think step by step.

Answer:
Gold answer: 70000
Source-alone (extracted): 195000
Source-alone full output:
Josh spent $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the house.
The house increased in value by 150%, so the new value is 130,000 + (130,000 * 1.5) = 130,000 + 195,000 = $<<130000+195000=325000>>325,000.
Josh made a profit of $325,000 - $130,000 = $<<325000-130000=195000>>195,000.

Target-alone (extracted): 12000
Target-alone full output:
1. The initial value of the house is $80,000.
2. After repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%.
3. To find the new value of the house, we multiply the initial value by 1.15 (150% as a decimal).
4. The new value of the house is $80,000 * 1.15 = $<<80000*1.15=92000>>92,000.
5. The profit Josh made is the difference between the new value and the initial value, which is $92,000 - $80,000 = $<<92000-80000=12000>>12,000.

Q: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
A: There are 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $<<0.50*12=6>>6 for the cans.
There are 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.50*4=6>>6 for the newspapers.
Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $<<6+6=12>>12.

Q: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
A: For the first year, Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = $<<1000+100*12=2200>>2200.
The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = $<<2200*10*.01=220>>220.
The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $<<2200+220=2420>>2420.
For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = $<<2420+100*12=3620>>3620.
The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = $<<3620*10*.01=362>>362.
Therefore, Joseph's investment in the mutual fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $<<3620+362=3982>>3982.

Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
A: Let's think step by step.

Answer:
Gold answer: 70000

Source-alone full output:
Josh spent $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the house.
The house increased in value by 150%, so the new value is 130,000 + (130,000 * 1.5) = 130,000 + 195,000 = $<<130000+195000=325000>>325,000.
Josh made a profit of $325,000 - $130,000 = $<<325000-130000=195000>>195,000.

Target-alone full output:
1. The initial value of the house is $80,000.
2. After repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%.
3. To find the new value of the house, we multiply the initial value by 1.15 (150% as a decimal).
4. The new value of the house is $80,000 * 1.15 = $<<80000*1.15=92000>>92,000.
5. The profit Josh made is the difference between the new value and the initial value, which is $92,000 - $80,000 = $<<92000-80000=12000>>12,000.

Q: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
A: There are 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $<<0.50*12=6>>6 for the cans.
There are 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.50*4=6>>6 for the newspapers.
Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $<<6+6=12>>12.

Q: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
A: For the first year, Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = $<<1000+100*12=2200>>2200.
The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = $<<2200*10*.01=220>>220.
The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $<<2200+220=2420>>2420.
For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = $<<2420+100*12=3620>>3620.
The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = $<<3620*10*.01=362>>362.
Therefore, Joseph's investment in the mutual fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $<<3620+362=3982>>3982.

Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
A: Let's think step by step.

Answer:
Gold answer: 70000
Source-alone (extracted): 195000
Source-alone full output:
Josh spent $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the house.
The house increased in value by 150%, so the new value is 130,000 + (130,000 * 1.5) = 130,000 + 195,000 = $<<130000+195000=325000>>325,000.
Josh made a profit of $325,000 - $130,000 = $<<325000-130000=195000>>195,000.

#### 125
Target-alone (extracted): 12000
Target-alone full output:
1. The initial value of the house is $80,000.
2. After repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%.
3. To find the new value of the house, we multiply the initial value by 1.15 (150% as a decimal).
4. The new value of the house is $80,000 * 1.15 = $<<80000*1.15=92000>>92,000.
5. The profit Josh made is the difference between the new value and the initial value, which is $92,000 - $80,000 = $<<92000-80000=12000>>12,000.

Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
A: First, let's calculate the value of the house after the repairs.

The value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000.

Since the value of the house increased by 150%, the profit Josh made is 150% of the value of the house after the repairs, which is 150% of $130,000 = $<<150*.013*10000=19500>>19,500.

Q: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
A: There are 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $<<0.50*12=6>>6 for the cans.
There are 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.50*4=6>>6 for the newspapers.
Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $<<6+6=12>>12.

Q: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
A: For the first year, Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = $<<1000+100*12=2200>>2200.
The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = $<<2200*10*.01=220>>220.
The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $<<2200+220=2420>>2420.
For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = $<<2420+100*12=3620>>3620.
The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = $<<3620*10*.01=362>>362.
Therefore, Joseph's investment in the mutual fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $<<3620+362=3982>>3982.

Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
A: Let's think step by step.

Answer:
Gold answer: 70000
Source-alone (extracted): 195000
Source-alone full output:
Josh spent $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the house.
The house increased in value by 150%, so the new value is 130,000 + (130,000 * 1.5) = 130,000 + 195,000 = $<<130000+195000=325000>>325,000.
Josh made a profit of $325,000 - $130,000 = $<<325000-130000=195000>>195,000.

Target-alone full output:
1. The initial value of the house is $80,000.
2. After repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%.
3. To find the new value of the house, we multiply the initial value by 1.15 (150% as a decimal).
4. The new value of the house is $80,000 * 1.15 = $<<80000*1.15=92000>>92,000.
5. The profit Josh made is the difference between the new value and the initial value, which is $92,000 - $80,000 = $<<92000-80000=12000>>12,000.

Q: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
A: There are 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $0.50 x 12 = $<<0.50*12=6>>6 for the cans.
There are 20/5 = <<20/5=4>>4 sets of 5 kilograms of newspapers that the family collected.
So, the family would receive $1.50 x 4 = $<<1.50*4=6>>6 for the newspapers.
Therefore, the family would receive a total of $6 + $6 = $<<6+6=12>>12.

Q: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
A: For the first year, Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = $<<1000+100*12=2200>>2200.
The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = $<<2200*10*.01=220>>220.
The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $<<2200+220=2420>>2420.
For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = $<<2420+100*12=3620>>3620.
The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = $<<3620*10*.01=362>>362.
Therefore, Joseph's investment in the mutual fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $<<3620+362=3982>>3982.

Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
A: Let's think step by step.

Answer:
Gold answer: 70000
Source-alone (extracted): 195000
Source-alone full output:
Josh spent $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the house.
The house increased in value by 150%, so the new value is 130,000 + (130,000 * 1.5) = 130,000 + 195,000 = $<<130000+195000=325000>>325,000.
Josh made a profit of $325,000 - $130,000 = $<<325000-130000=195000>>195,000.

#### 125
Target-alone (extracted): 12000
Target-alone full output:
1. The initial value of the house is $80,000.
2. After repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%.
3. To find the new value of the house, we multiply the initial value by 1.15 (150% as a decimal).
4. The new value of the house is $80,000 * 1.15 = $<<80000*1.15=92000>>92,000.
5. The profit Josh made is the difference between the new value and the initial value, which is $92,000 - $80,000 = $<<92000-80000=12000>>12,000.

Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
A: First, let's calculate the value of the house after repairs.

The value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000.

Since the value of the house increased by 150%, the profit Josh made is 150% of $130,000 = $<<150*.01*130000=19500>>19,500.

Q: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
A: There are 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.

Q: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
A: For the first year, Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = $<<1000+100*12=2200>>2200.
The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = $<<2200*10*.01=220>>220.
The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $<<2200+220=2420>>2420.
For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = $<<2420+100*12=3620>>3620.
The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = $<<3620*10*.01=362>>362.
Therefore, Joseph's investment in the mutual fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $<<3620+362=3982>>3982.

A: Let's think step by step.

Answer:
Gold answer: 70000

Josh spent $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the house.
The house increased in value by 150%, so the new value is 130,000 + (130,000 * 1.5) = 130,000 + 195,000 = $<<130000+195000=325000>>325,000.
Josh made a profit of $325,000 - $130,000 = $<<325000-130000=195000>>195,000.

1. The initial value of the house is $80,000.
2. After repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%.
3. To find the new value of the house, we multiply the initial value by 1.15 (150% as a decimal).
4. The new value of the house is $80,000 * 1.15 = $<<80000*1.15=92000>>92,000.
5. The profit Josh made is the difference between the new value and the initial value, which is $92,000 - $80,000 = $<<92000-80000=12000>>12,000.

Q: For every 12 cans you recycle, you receive $0.50, and for every 5 kilograms of newspapers, you receive $1.50. If your family collected 144 cans and 20 kilograms of newspapers, how much money would you receive?
A: There are 144/12 = <<144/12=12>>12 sets of 12 cans that the family collected.

Q: Joseph invested $1000 into a hedge fund. The fund promised a yearly interest rate of 10%. If he deposited an additional $100 every month into the account to add to his initial investment of $1000, how much money will he have in the fund after two years?
A: For the first year, Joseph will have invested $1000 + ($100 * 12) = $<<1000+100*12=2200>>2200.
The interest calculated for the first year will be $2200 * 10% = $<<2200*10*.01=220>>220.
The total value of the investment for the first year will be $2200 + $220 = $<<2200+220=2420>>2420.
For the second year, the total invested will be $2420 + ($100 * 12) = $<<2420+100*12=3620>>3620.
The interest calculated after the second year will be $3620 * 10% = $<<3620*10*.01=362>>362.
Therefore, Joseph's investment in the mutual fund will be worth $3620 + $362 = $<<3620+362=3982>>3982.

Q: The price of buying a wooden toy at the new Craftee And Best store is $20, and the cost of buying a hat is $10. If Kendra went to the shop with a $100 bill and bought two wooden toys and three hats, calculate the change she received.
A: When Kendra bought 2 toys, she paid 2*$20 = $<<2*20=40>>40
Since the price of a hat is $10, when Kendra bought 3 hats, she paid 3*$10 = $<<3*10=30>>30
The total costs for the hats and wooden toys Kendra bought is $40+$30 = $<<40+30=70>>70
From the $100 bill, Kendra received change worth $100-$70 =$<<100-70=30>>30

Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
A: Let's think step by step.

Answer:
Gold answer: 70000
Source-alone (extracted): 195000
Source-alone full output:
Josh spent $80,000 + $50,000 = $<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000 on the house.
The house increased in value by 150%, so the new value is 130,000 + (130,000 * 1.5) = 130,000 + 195,000 = $<<130000+195000=325000>>325,000.
Josh made a profit of $325,000 - $130,000 = $<<325000-130000=195000>>195,000.

Target-alone (extracted): 12000
Target-alone full output:
1. The initial value of the house is $80,000.
2. After repairs, the value of the house increased by 150%.
3. To find the new value of the house, we multiply the initial value by 1.15 (150% as a decimal).
4. The new value of the house is $80,000 * 1.15 = $<<80000*1.15=92000>>92,000.
5. The profit Josh made is the difference between the new value and the initial value, which is $92,000 - $80,000 = $<<92000-80000=12000>>12,000.
