# E2: Diversity Regularization Sweep
# Tests if explicit orthogonality constraints reduce query collapse (cosine=0.999)
#
# Hypothesis: Direct Sequence Compression failed because learned queries collapsed.
# Diversity regularization should force queries to specialize to different input aspects.
#
# Evidence: LOG.md shows cosine=0.999 between representations, NN diversity=0.0
# System-1/2 paper shows high cross-subspace capture and near-zero silhouettes

Configuration: $name
Diversity loss type: $loss_type
Diversity loss weight: $weight
Latent length M: $M
Samples: $SAMPLES
Steps: $STEPS
Dataset: $DATASET

Status: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
Required changes:
- Add diversity_reg_weight and diversity_reg_type to config.py
- Implement cosine_orth loss: min sum_{i<j} cos(query_i, query_j)^2
- Implement covariance loss: min ||Cov(queries) - I||_F
- Add to train.py loss computation

Expected outcome if implemented:
- Cosine similarity between queries should decrease
- NN diversity score should increase
- Output diversity should improve from 10% baseline
