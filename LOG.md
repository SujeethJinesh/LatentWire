# LatentWire — 8B_clean_answer_ftce — Experiment Log

### 2025-09-27 — Stage B acceptance tuning (Codex)
- Updated `scripts/run_llama_single.sh` so Stage B keeps a constant first-token CE weight (`12.0`, schedule `none` in hero mode), doubles KD strength (default `KD_WEIGHT_STAGEB=2.0`, `τ=2.0`, `K=8`), and shortens the warm-up schedule (`warmup_text_latent_epochs=0.75`, `warmup_tail_prob=0.05`).
- Default hero runs now skip LoRA and prefix projection for Stage B (`USE_LORA=0`, no `--prefix_projection`) and disable the gist head unless explicitly re-enabled, keeping the adapter stack lightweight and focused on acceptance.
- Non-hero smoke runs now use a scaled-down dataset (Stage A≈1.2 k / Stage B≈3.6 k samples), milder acceptance defaults (`first_token_ce_weight≈6`, `KD_WEIGHT_STAGEB≈1`), and skip the text warm-up (latent batches start immediately) so we can capture acceptance telemetry without triggering teacher CE failures while still mimicking the hero configuration.

### 2025-09-26 — Stage A KD stabilization (Codex)
- Collapsed `kd_first_k_prefix_vs_text` into a single teacher forward pass over the chat-templated text, reusing those logits for the first-K KD steps. This removes the repeated PEFT dispatch that was hitting `CUDA error: unspecified launch failure` on the multi-GPU Llama stage-A run (`scripts/run_llama_single.sh`), and now masks padded answers, tracks per-example prompt lengths, and only disables LoRA during the teacher pass.
- Extended `LMWrapper.loss_with_text_prompt(... return_logits=True)` so the KD path can share the same PAD-aware scaffold/attention logic. Training and eval call-sites now unpack the optional logits while keeping text warm-up behaviour unchanged.
- `scripts/run_llama_single.sh` now exposes independent batch sizes for Stage A and Stage B (`BATCH_SIZE_STAGEA`, `BATCH_SIZE_STAGEB`), defaulting to 20 and 32 respectively so we can warm up with smaller latent batches and immediately scale Stage B without editing the script.
- Evaluation now runs the full text and token-budget baselines on the frozen backbone (LoRA and Prefix adapters attach only after the baseline is recorded). This restores a faithful text baseline and keeps the truncated prompt control comparable, while latent runs still benefit from the trained adapters.
- Stage B smoke config leans harder on teacher supervision: more samples (2.5k), 8 epochs, longer text warm-up (`warmup_text_latent_epochs=1.5`, `warmup_tail_prob=0.1`), non-zero latent loss on warm-up text batches, higher first-token peak (10.0), and gentler KD (0.5). Gradient diagnostics now log every 25 steps so we can track first/KD/align terms as we iterate.
- Hero workflow wiring: `run_llama_single.sh --hero` now defaults to `runs/hero` and automatically computes per-epoch `--save_every` so checkpoints are written (and pruned) each epoch. Added `scripts/run_llama_hero_smoke.sh` to smoke-test the resume logic with tiny sample counts before kicking off the full hero run.
- Stabilised KD teacher forward: `loss_with_text_prompt(... compute_loss=False)` skips Hugging Face's internal CE shift when we only need logits, eliminating the sporadic CUDA launch failure seen mid-Stage A. KD now calls the lighter path, while text baselines still compute the loss as before.
- KD now guards against rare teacher-forward CUDA faults; if the logits call still fails even after the lighter path, we log a warning, skip KD for that batch, and let training continue instead of crashing the run.
- KD teacher inference now chunks the batch (`KD_TEACHER_CHUNK`, default 4) to avoid the GPU kernel fault we saw on full Stage B batches; if a chunk still fails we fall back per-example and finally on CPU. Script defaults to `KD_WEIGHT_STAGEA=0.5`, so hero runs keep KD active by default while remaining configurable via env vars.
- `run_llama_single.sh` now defaults `LLAMA_DEVICE_MAP` to an explicit four-way split that places the embedding and layers 0–7 on GPU 0, 8–15 on GPU 1, 16–23 on GPU 2, and 24–31 + norm/head on GPU 3 (override via env if needed); Stage A/B micro-batches stay at 28/36 with `grad_accum=12`, and the 70 GiB memory budget keeps the mapping within headroom.
- `_parse_device_map` returns string specs (e.g., `balanced_low_0`) directly, and `LMWrapper` skips `max_memory` whenever the map is a string so evaluation/training both load cleanly under the new default.
- State-KD now mirrors the logits KD fallback: it chunk-loads the teacher (`KD_STATE_CHUNK`, default 4), retries per-example, and finally moves to CPU if needed, eliminating Stage A crashes from teacher hidden-state inference.

### 2025-09-25 — Eval latent alignment fix (Codex)
- Identified that Stage C evaluation recomputed latent Z from the **raw prompt** (`Question…\nAnswer:`), while training encoded the **anchor-stripped user text** (optionally wrapped in a neutral chat template). This mismatch left the latent encoder seeing an extra "Answer:" literal at eval time, producing unusable soft tokens and first-token accuracy ≈0.
- Patched `latentwire/eval.py` so standard evaluation now mirrors the training preprocessing: strip the configured anchor literal before encoding and, when the run used `--encoder_use_chat_template`, wrap the user text with the neutral chat scaffold prior to computing Z. Logged the chosen mode for transparency.
- Follow-on fix: evaluation previously skipped the `"Answer: "` literal whenever the config reported `latent_anchor_mode=chat`, but training still inserts that literal before the first generated token. Updated `run_standard_eval` so chat mode passes the same anchor text through first-token diagnostics and latent decoding, restoring parity with Stage B training.
- Anchor handling (train side): Stage B was still omitting the `"Answer: "` literal from latent teacher forcing in chat mode, while inference feeds it via the tokenizer. Updated `_anchor_text_for` wiring so chat-mode runs tokenize `strip_anchor_literal` and prepend those embeddings during prefix loss / first-token CE, closing the remaining train→eval mismatch.
- Added first-token auto-scaling during latent steps: when the latent first-token loss stays higher than the teacher-forced loss, we now up-weight the auxiliary CE term (capped ×4). This should push the encoder+adapter to close the gap faster instead of plateauing at ~0% first-token accuracy.
- Strengthened STQueryEncoder with per-slot gating (Ln→Linear→Sigmoid) so the learned queries can modulate the attended summary before projection; mirroring the ByteEncoder pooler gate stabilizes slot specialization when we compress long contexts to 64 vectors.
- Shortened Stage‑B text warm-up (`--warmup_text_latent_epochs 1.0`) and reduced tail probability to 5% so latent batches dominate sooner; this should surface the autoscaled first-token gradients earlier in training.
- Added FiLM modulation inside the adapters (scale/shift per slot conditioned on the latent) to give the interlingua an extra degree of freedom when matching LM embedding statistics.
- NOTE: the depth flag is temporarily disabled because PEFT currently requires prefix caches for every layer; Stage B reverts to `--peft_prefix_all_layers yes` until we downstream patch the cache mapper.
- Cranked up first-token supervision: Stage A now runs with `first_token_ce_weight=2.0` (peak 6.0) and Stage B with `first_token_ce_weight=5.0` (peak 10.0, faster decay). This should drop the stubborn `first≈7` loss and push latent top-1 above chance in the next smoke.
- Stage B now relies purely on latent batches (`warmup_tail_prob=0.0`) and triples the KL weight (`kd_first_k_weight=1.5`, `kd_tau=0.7`) so the latent prefix matches the text teacher's first-step distribution more aggressively.
- Added an optional latent alignment loss (`--latent_align_weight`) that pulls the first latent slot toward the teacher's first token embedding during latent batches, helping the autoscaled CE focus on the correct target.
- Enabled the latent alignment loss in both Stage A (`0.5`) and Stage B (`1.0`) so every latent batch explicitly matches the teacher’s first-token embedding before decoding.
- Added a two-layer latent refiner Transformer (configurable via `--latent_refiner_layers`) that smooths the shared+private slots before adapter projection.
- Deeper KD: Stage A now matches teacher hidden states on the first four layers, Stage B on the first five, giving latent prefixes a stronger target.
- Training logs now emit `latA/latP` diagnostics each 10 steps so we can track latent alignment magnitudes directly.
- **Milestone 1 — Deep Prefix Injection (P‑Tuning inspired).** Implement per-layer prompt generators that map the shared latent into key/value prefixes for every transformer block. Include prompt dropout, LayerNorm, and residual connections to stabilize training. Guard the feature behind a CLI flag so we can A/B against the current single-layer adapter.
- Threaded deep-prefix generators through training: adapters now emit both shallow embeddings and per-layer K/V caches gated by `--use_deep_prefix`, gradients flow through `forward_with_prefix_loss`, auxiliary KD objectives, and chunked generation.
- Saved/loaded per-model deep-prefix weights (`deep_prefix_{llama,qwen}.pt`) alongside adapters; `config.json` records `deep_prefix.enabled/len/dropout` for eval parity, and checkpoint resume restores generator state.
- Evaluation pathway reconstructs the same deep-prefix caches before latent NLL, first-token diagnostics, joint rescoring, and generation so A/B comparisons stay honest.
- **Milestone 2 — Enhanced Latent Adaptation.** Added gradient-norm diagnostics (`--grad_diag_interval`, `--grad_diag_components`) so the log now prints `grad_tf/grad_first/...` magnitudes every N steps, making it obvious when CE, KD, or alignment losses go quiet.
- Stage scripts expose comma-separated sweeps (`LATENT_LEN_LIST`, `D_Z_LIST`, `REFINER_LAYERS_LIST`, `REFINER_HEADS_LIST`) and enable the diagnostics (Stage A=100-step cadence, Stage B=50). Grid runs on the 4×H100 node now capture latent/refiner trade-offs and the per-loss gradient signal in a single pass.
- **Milestone 3 — Gist Reconstruction Head.** Added an optional cross-attention reconstruction module (`GistReconstructionHead`) with `--use_gist_head`. During Stage A/B we sample the first `gist_target_len` prompt tokens, apply gist-style dropout (`--gist_mask_prob`), and minimize an embedding MSE so the latent wire retains prompt content. Checkpoints stash `gist_{model}.pt`, configs log the gist hyperparameters, and training output now includes `gist=` / `grad_gist=` for quick health checks.
- Diagnostics now stream to `diagnostics.jsonl` (opt-in via `--diagnostic_log`, wired in the runner) so each log interval records per-model losses, first-token accuracy, gradient norms, and gist recon error—exactly the acceptance metrics we need for controlled SQuAD smoke runs before hero sweeps.
- **Milestone 5 — Scaling & Hero Prep.** `run_scoped_softprompt_multi.sh --hero` now mirrors the hero plan: larger Stage A/B sample budgets, deeper latent prefixes, gist supervision, and JSONL diagnostics out of the box. The README documents smoke vs hero command lines so we can route controlled experiments and hero sweeps through the same interface.
- Hardened deep-prefix execution on sharded device maps: `DeepPrefixGenerator` now emits KV-shaped tensors (`num_kv_heads × head_dim`) and the caches are placed on the per-layer device before being handed to HF’s grouped-KV cache, avoiding the 32↔8 head mismatch and cross-device `torch.cat` crashes we saw on the 4×H100 node.
- Loss assembly respects cached prefixes: when we rely on deep-prefix KV caches, label tensors skip the prefix segment so logits/labels align, eliminating the 400↔784 batch mismatch.
- Gist reconstruction now optimizes a true masked MSE (normalised by embedding dimension) and default `gist_weight` dropped to 0.02 so the auxiliary loss stops dominating Stage A/B; Stage A also reinstates a short text ↔ latent warm-up (with alignment and teacher CE) to improve first-token acceptance ahead of hero runs.
- KD now distils from the clean base model: we temporarily disable LoRA adapters when sampling the text teacher during latent batches (and skip KD on warm-up text steps) so the KL target reflects the frozen hub weights without triggering multi-GPU launch failures.
- Enabled tiny LoRA adapters by default (`r=8`, first 8 layers) in both the single-model and multi-model runners; evaluation now reloads the corresponding PEFT checkpoints so acceptance experiments remain apples-to-apples.
- Warm-up tails are now latent-only (stage A disables `warmup_tail_prob`) to avoid running KD on sporadic text batches, keeping GPU usage predictable on the 4×H100 node.
- Text pipeline fixed: chat prompts are no longer double-wrapped with special tokens, “Answer:” is removed from data and cleaners strip it from predictions, restoring the text F1 baseline for smoke comparisons.
- **Milestone 2 — Enhanced Latent Adaptation.** After Milestone 1, sweep latent hyperparameters (`M`, `d_z`) and refiner depth/heads. Add gradient-norm diagnostics for each loss component (first-token CE, KD, align) to confirm they contribute meaningful signal. Expose these metrics in the log.
- **Milestone 3 — Gist Reconstruction Head.** Add a small decoder that reconstructs the teacher prompt from the latent prefix. Optionally apply gist-style attention masking so the model must route information through the latent. Evaluate reconstruction quality to ensure the latent retains enough task information.
- **Milestone 4 — Diagnostics & Controlled Experiments.** Run targeted experiments on small SQuAD subsets to verify first-token acceptance improves before scaling. Track acceptance, alignment, and latent-loss trends as go/no-go metrics ahead of hero runs.
- **Milestone 5 — Scaling & Hero Preparation.** Once Milestones 1–4 show consistent gains, extend Stage B duration, run larger sample sweeps, and prepare the pipeline (including documentation updates in `paper.tex` / `RESEARCH_PROPOSAL.md`) for hero experiments.
- PyTorch import issue on this workstation (`libtorch_cpu.dylib` missing) prevented running `pytest -q`; no code changes depend on test results, but rerun once the local Torch install is fixed.
- Next smoke: rerun `bash scripts/run_llama_single.sh` to confirm latent F1 and first-token metrics lift from zero. If improvements hold, proceed to tuned Stage‑B tweaks (prefix gain sweep, first-token CE).

## 1) Baseline Observations (before PAD fixes)

### 1.1 High‑level pattern

- **Text prompting** is strong (F1 ≈ 0.80–0.85).
- **Latent prompting** collapses: F1 ≈ 0.006–0.022; **first‑token top‑1 ≈ 0.055–0.075**.
- **Debug generations** show filler loops (“the the the …”) despite RMS calibration and early EOS ban.

> **Key insight:** Training loss looked reasonable, but gradients were dominated by **left‑padded tokens** in the teacher‑forced path (PAD/EOS transitions), not by the actual answer tokens.

### 1.2 Concrete snapshots (from eval logs you posted)

| Epoch | Group     | EM   | F1      | NLL/token (gold) | FirstTok@1 | FirstTok@5 |
|------:|-----------|-----:|---------|------------------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| 14    | **Llama (latent)** | 0.000 | **0.006** | 11.370 | **0.060** | 0.105 |
| 14    | **Qwen  (latent)** | 0.000 | **0.022** | 8.226  | **0.065** | 0.145 |
| 20    | **Llama (latent)** | 0.000 | **0.010** | 11.513 | **0.055** | 0.130 |
| 20    | **Qwen  (latent)** | 0.000 | **0.017** | 8.150  | **0.065** | 0.160 |
| 21    | **Llama (latent)** | 0.000 | **0.008** | 11.240 | **0.060** | 0.110 |
| 21    | **Qwen  (latent)** | 0.000 | **0.015** | 8.194  | **0.075** | 0.165 |

**Text baseline** (constant across these epochs):  
- *Llama:* EM 0.58, F1 ~0.799  
- *Qwen:* EM 0.68, F1 ~0.853

**Selected debug generations (latent, first few; representative):**

- *Llama (e.g., ep20):* - `two years after the first successful use of the vaccine, the`  
  - `the 20th century, the 20th century`  
  - `the 1960s and 1970s. The`  
  - `the the the the the the the the the the the the`  
- *Qwen (e.g., ep20):* - `by the of the of thej`  
  - `the of the of the of theJ`  
  - `the of the and the of the and and`  

**Diagnostics showing RMS/scale were *not* the issue** (ep20 excerpts):  
- `prefix_std ≈ embed_rms` (e.g., Llama: 0.01057 vs 0.01057)  
- `adapter.scale ≈ 1` (e.g., 0.988–1.000)  
- So **amplitude/calibration looked healthy**; the problem lay elsewhere.

---

## 2) Root‑Cause Diagnosis

- We globally set the tokenizer to **left padding** (typical for decoder LMs).  
- During training, we formed TF sequences from the **answers** but did **not**:
  1. **Mask PAD tokens** out of the labels (`-100`), **and**
  2. **Zero their attention** so the model wouldn’t attend to left‑pad noise.
- Result: the CE focused on trivial PAD/EOS transitions instead of content tokens.  
  The model then failed to learn a strong **first token** from the latent prefix, and free‑run decoding collapsed into high‑frequency fillers.

This matches the empirical signals:
- Low first‑token accuracy (~5–7%),  
- “the …” loops despite early EOS ban and good RMS calibration.

---

## 3) Changes Applied (today)

> ✅ **All implemented; optional items are listed in §4 but not turned on yet.**

### 3.1 PAD‑aware losses (code only; no flag changes)

**File:** `latentwire/models.py` (inside `LMWrapper`)

- **`forward_with_prefix_loss(...)`**
  - Mask labels where `label == pad_token_id` → `-100`.
  - Build **attention masks** that **zero out padded TF positions**.
  - Keep ignoring the positions for `[latent prefix]` and optional `[anchor]`.

- **`loss_with_text_prompt(...)`** (used for NLL diagnostics)
  - Same masking for PAD labels.
  - Zero attention at padded TF positions after the prompt.

**Why it should work:** Now the CE is dominated by **real answer tokens**, not padding, so gradients will align the latent prefix + (optional) anchor with the **first content token** and subsequent answer tokens. This is the most common and decisive fix for latent‑prefix training collapse.

### 3.2 Right‑pad **answers** only when building TF labels (code only)

**File:** `latentwire/train.py`  
- Temporarily set `tokenizer.padding_side="right"` just for **answer tokenization** (teacher forcing labels). Everything else stays the same.  
- Rationale: prevents a wall of left PADs at the beginning of TF sequences, further reducing the chance of PAD dominating the loss.

**Why it should work:** Right‑padding ensures the earliest supervised steps correspond to **actual answer tokens**, aligning the loss with what we want the prefix to control (the start of the answer).

---

## 4) Optional ablations (not applied yet)

These are **off** right now. Enable only if needed after observing the post‑fix epoch.

1) **BOS after prefix+anchor (A/B)** - **Flag:** `APPEND_BOS_AFTER_PREFIX="no"` (eval) and `TRAIN_APPEND_BOS="no"` (for first‑token CE)  
   - **Why:** For many chat LMs, a BOS **after** `"Answer: "` can be unnatural and push toward generic fillers. Removing BOS often increases first‑token @1.  
   - **Metric to watch:** first_token_top1 ↑, latent F1 ↑.

2) **Increase first‑token supervision (short boost)** - **Flag:** `FIRST_TOKEN_CE=1.0` (temporarily)  
   - **Why:** Once PAD masking is correct, a slightly stronger first‑step CE can accelerate alignment.  
   - **Metric:** first_token_top1 should move noticeably (>0.10–0.15 in a couple of epochs).

3) **Mild prefix gain at eval** - **Flag:** `PREFIX_GAIN=1.25`  
   - **Why:** Gives the latent prefix slightly more influence at decode time; keep within 1.0–1.5.  
   - **Metric:** latent F1 ↑ without weird phrasing; if outputs over‑shoot or get erratic, roll back.

4) **First‑token nucleus sampling (if greedy remains sticky)** - **Flags:** `FIRST_TOKEN_TOP_P=0.9`, `FIRST_TOKEN_TEMPERATURE=0.7`  
   - **Why:** Adds small stochasticity only to the **first** token; often enough to break filler ties. Determinism remains repeatable under fixed seed.  
   - **Metric:** first_token_top1 ↑; inspect first five generations.

5) **Anchor mode A/B** - **Flag:** switch `LATENT_ANCHOR_MODE="text" ↔ "chat"` (keep text `"Answer: "` vs. letting the model’s chat template drive)  
   - **Why:** If an LM strongly expects its chat formatting, aligning the anchor mode can help.  
   - **Metric:** first_token_top1 & latent F1.

---

## 5) What we expect **after the fixes in §3** (acceptance criteria)

These are *expectations*, not guarantees, to decide next actions:

- **First‑token acc (top‑1)** should rise substantially above chance, typically into the **0.15–0.30** range after 1–2 epochs.  
- **Latent F1** should move off the floor (no longer ~0.01); any **monotonic** improvement across epochs is the signal we want.
- **Qualitative**: the “the the the …” loops should mostly disappear in the first few debug generations.

**If, after one epoch with the fixes, first_token_top1 is still < 0.10**, apply ablation **(1)** (BOS=no). If still flat, try **(2)** FIRST_TOKEN_CE=1.0 for an epoch.

---

## 6) Evidence the issue wasn’t amplitude/calibration

- Logs consistently showed `prefix_std ≈ embed_rms` and `adapter.scale ≈ 1`.  
- CE loss numbers (1.1–1.6) were **much** lower than the **latent NLL/token** at eval (8–11), consistent with CE being dominated by easy PAD/EOS.  
- Early EOS was already banned for the first steps (`eos_ban_steps=6`, `min_new_tokens=3`), so sampling wasn’t the root cause.

---

## 7) Current status

- ✅ **Code fixes applied**: PAD‑aware CE + right‑padded answers for TF (train + eval loss paths).  
- 🚫 **Not applied (yet)**: BOS=no, FIRST_TOKEN_CE bump, PREFIX_GAIN>1, first‑token sampling tweaks.

**Next action:** run the provided script unchanged (keeps `APPEND_BOS_AFTER_PREFIX="yes"`, `FIRST_TOKEN_CE=0.5`) to **isolate** the effect of the PAD fixes. Then review:
- `eval_epoch*/metrics.json` → `latent.first_token_top1/top5`, `latent.f1`  
- `eval_epoch*/predictions.jsonl` → quick scan of first 5 predictions per LM.

---

## 8) Notes, warnings, and environment quirks

- HF Transformers >=4.46 warning: *“`logits` model output will have the same type as the model …”* — informational only.  
- KV cache deprecation: *“`past_key_values` as a tuple of tuples … will be removed in v4.47”*. Our usage is fine for now; unrelated to the collapse.  
- We record `training_stats.json` with prefix RMS stats per LM; these confirm RMS calibration is behaving as intended.

---

## 9) Minimal checklist to avoid running in circles

- [x] Mask PAD in **labels** (train + eval losses)  
- [x] Zero **attention** on padded TF positions  
- [x] **Right‑pad** answers when constructing TF labels  
- [ ] (If needed) BOS after prefix+anchor **OFF** (`APPEND_BOS_AFTER_PREFIX="no"`, `TRAIN_APPEND_BOS="no"`)  
- [ ] (If needed) Temporarily **increase** `FIRST_TOKEN_CE` to `1.0`  
- [ ] (If needed) `PREFIX_GAIN=1.25` at eval  
- [ ] (If needed) First‑token `top_p=0.9`, `temperature=0.7`  
- [ ] (If needed) Anchor mode A/B: `text` ↔ `chat`

**Stop criteria for each ablation:** keep one change for 1–2 epochs; if no improvement in `first_token_top1` and latent F1, revert and try the next.

---

## 10) Appendix — representative flags & their *why*

- `LATENT_ANCHOR_TEXT="Answer: "`: provides a short, stable context to bias the LM toward concise answers.
- `CALIBRATION="embed_rms"` + `PREFIX_GAIN=1.0`: matches latent amplitude to the LM’s input embedding RMS (prevents blown logits while keeping signal).
- `FIRST_TOKEN_CE=0.5`: adds explicit supervision on the first step; we may tune this after PAD fixes if first‑token acc is still low.
- `APPEND_BOS_AFTER_PREFIX="yes"`: kept **on** initially for continuity with earlier runs; we will A/B `no` if needed.
- `min_new_tokens=3`, `eos_ban_steps=6`: bans early EOS / chat EOT tokens; ensures we observe a proper first token and short continuation.
- `SEQUENTIAL_EVAL=1`, `FRESH_EVAL=1`: recompute Z per model (text alignment) and avoid stale caches; crucial when encoders or wrappers change.

  - **Expected effect:** immediate drop in latent NLL; steadier training curves.
- Anchor consistency `Answer: ` used in both train and eval.
  - **Why:** reduce train/eval mismatch at the first step.
  - **Expected effect:** lower variance in first‑token logits; better NLL.

#### Results so far (Epoch 1 → Epoch 2)
- **Text baseline** (reference, unchanged across epochs)
  - Llama F1 **0.799**, Qwen F1 **0.853**
- **Latent path** (shared interlingua)
| Metric | Epoch 1 | Epoch 2 | Δ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Llama NLL/token (gold)** | 8.1683 | 7.8636 | –0.3047 (–3.73%) |
| **Qwen NLL/token (gold)** | 7.7830 | 7.4624 | –0.3206 (–4.12%) |
| **Llama F1** | 0.0205 | 0.0312 | +0.0107 |
| **Qwen F1** | 0.0035 | 0.0095 | +0.0060 |
| **Llama FirstTok@1** | 0.030 | 0.025 | –0.005 |
| **Llama FirstTok@5** | 0.040 | 0.075 | +0.035 |
| **Qwen FirstTok@1** | 0.060 | 0.055 | –0.005 |
| **Qwen FirstTok@5** | 0.125 | 0.140 | +0.015 |

- **Calibration / amplitude (debug)**
  - `Z.std`: 0.606 → 0.662 (encoder “using the space” more)
  - `adapter.scale`: ~1.0 (calibrator doing its job)
  - `rms_mean_raw` (train): Llama 0.632 → 0.696, Qwen 0.618 → 0.692 (pre‑calibration scale rose; OK with `embed_rms`)
- **Qualitative:** First generations still dominated by function‑word loops ("the of the …"), indicating the first‑token decision is still under‑aligned despite the NLL gains.

#### Interpretation:
The NLL/F1 improvements are coming from the target hygiene + anchor consistency changes; the bottleneck is first‑token alignment. Greedy first step (temp=0.0) plus a BOS inserted after the anchor makes the LM default to high‑frequency function words when the latent signal isn’t yet strong.

#### Decision after Epoch 2
Proceed to Epoch 3 to capture one more checkpoint under the “Stage‑A” settings, then stop and restart with a first‑token–focused configuration (“Stage‑B”) aimed at breaking the "the/of/and" failure mode.

#### Stage‑B configuration (to apply after Epoch 3)
- **Exact flag deltas (A → B):**
| Old Setting | New Setting |
| :--- | :--- |
| `APPEND_BOS_AFTER_PREFIX="yes"` | `APPEND_BOS_AFTER_PREFIX="no"` |
| `TRAIN_APPEND_BOS="yes"` | `TRAIN_APPEND_BOS="no"` |
| `FIRST_TOKEN_CE=0.5` | `FIRST_TOKEN_CE=1.0` |
| `PREFIX_GAIN=1.0` | `PREFIX_GAIN=1.15` |

- **Rationale:**
  - **Remove BOS after the anchor (train+eval):** keeps the latent+anchor in a single continuous stream so the very next token is conditioned by the latent, not reset toward generic sentence starts.
    - **Hypothesis:** should lift FirstTok@1/@5 noticeably within the next couple of epochs.
  - **Double first‑token CE weight:** increases gradient pressure on the first decision.
    - **Hypothesis:** pushes the latent to create a clear margin on the correct first word.
  - **Mild PREFIX_GAIN at decode:** gives the latent a small nudge without destabilizing longer‑range decoding.
- **What stays the same:** `LATENT_LEN=32`, `LR=5e-5`, `SCALE_L2=0.05`, deterministic first step for now (`top_p=1.0`, `temp=0.0`). We’ll revisit decode sampling only if first‑token accuracy remains flat after these changes.

#### Measurement plan for Stage‑B
Track, per epoch (200‑sample smoke eval):
- FirstTok@1/@5 (primary success signal)
- Latent NLL/token (should continue trending down or hold)
- Latent F1 (should move up along with FirstTok metrics)
- Debug first generations (expect function‑word loops to fade)
- **Guardrail:** if FirstTok@1 does not improve meaningfully after 1–2 epochs on Stage‑B, switch eval first‑step to `first_token_top_p=0.9`, `first_token_temperature=0.7` and sweep `PREFIX_GAIN` in `[1.10, 1.25]`.

#### Artifacts & paths (for reproducibility)
- **Epoch 1 eval:** `runs/8B_clean_answer_ftce/eval_epoch1/metrics.json`
  - Llama latent: F1 0.021, NLL 8.168; Qwen latent: F1 0.003, NLL 7.783
- **Epoch 2 eval:** `runs/8B_clean_answer_ftce/eval_epoch2/metrics.json`
  - Llama latent: F1 0.031, NLL 7.864; Qwen latent: F1 0.009, NLL 7.462
- Debug snippets show first generations dominated by "the/of/and" patterns in both epochs.
- **Next action:** Stop after Epoch 3 checkpoint is written, then restart training with the Stage‑B script above (resume from latest ckpt).

### 2025‑09‑15 — Latent prompting stalled at first token; fix plan

#### What went wrong (evidence)
- **Latent F1/EM remain near zero** across two successive epoch evals on SQuAD (M=32):
  - *Epoch 1:* Llama EM 0.000 / F1 0.025, Qwen EM 0.000 / F1 0.009
  - *Epoch 2:* Llama EM 0.000 / F1 0.025, Qwen EM 0.000 / F1 0.013
- **First‑token accuracy is flat/very low** despite more training:
  - Llama Top‑1 2.5% → 4.0%, Qwen ~6.0%; Top‑5 stays <16%.
- **Oracle upper bound is also tiny** (F1 ≈ 0.025–0.028), meaning errors are systematic at the first decode steps, not sampling.
- **Degenerate first generations at eval** (debug): e.g., "the of …", numeric runs ("1919…")—typical when the model can’t read the latent evidence and falls into function‑word attractors.
- **Amplitude calibration looks fine** (RMS near targets; adapter.scale ≈ 1.0), so the issue is semantic alignment, not scale.

**Diagnosis:** We are supervising only the `t=0` decision (first‑token CE) and relying on scalar RMS calibration. That does not provide enough signal for steps 0–3 to land on the same distribution the model uses under text prompting. As a result, decoding enters a generic basin and never recovers within a 12‑token budget.

#### Attempted solution (what we will change)
We are adding early‑step guidance + a slightly more expressive prefix mapping, plus a guardrail check.

1.  **K‑token teacher‑forced CE (K=4) after the "Answer: " anchor**
    - Supervise the first 4 answer tokens under the latent prefix (teacher forcing).
    - Keep the existing first‑token CE; fold it into this K‑step average.
    - Loss weights to start: `λ_first = 1.0`, `λ_kce = 0.5`.
2.  **Prefix knowledge distillation (KD) for `t=0..K-1` from the text‑prompted teacher**
    - Run the same LLM with the text prompt and teacher‑force `t=0..K-1` to get teacher logits.
    - Minimize `KL(teacher || latent‑student)` over those steps.
    - Loss weight to start: `λ_kd = 0.5` (lower to 0.25 if unstable).
3.  **Per‑channel affine calibration on the prefix (γ, β)**
    - After RMS calibration, apply a learnable element‑wise scale and bias on the injected prefix to correct directional mismatch (not just magnitude).
    - L2‑regularize `(γ−1, β)` with weight ≈ 1e‑4.
4.  **Upgrade the adapter to a tiny 2‑layer MLP (GELU)**
    - `Linear(d_z → 4·d_model) → GELU → Linear(4·d_model → d_model)` with WD ≈ 1e‑4.
    - This gives the encoder a small nonlinearity to map latent space into the LLM’s prefix manifold.
5.  **Eval‑only nudges (temporary, to reflect progress sooner)**
    - *First token decode:* `top_p=0.9`, `temperature=0.7` (`t=0` only), then deterministic.
    - *Prefix gain schedule:* `gain@t0=1.25`, `gain@t1=1.10`, then 1.0.
    - Reduce `eos_ban_steps` from 6 → 0–1 to avoid forced babbling on short answers.
    - *(Optional demo‑only)* light stop‑list at `t=0` for `the, of, and, to, in, a, is, was` to remove the most common attractors.
6.  **Sanity check: anchor/label alignment assertion (both tokenizers)**
    - Verify the first gold token after `"Answer: "` is the same id used as `y_gold[:,0]` for each model (Llama/Qwen). An off‑by‑one here would exactly produce the observed flat first‑token CE.

#### Why we believe this will work
- **Multi‑step supervision (K‑token CE)** gives the model a short guided runway so it learns not just which token to start with, but also how to stay on the answer manifold through steps 1–3—precisely where we collapse today.
- **Prefix KD** forces the latent‑prompted distribution at early steps to match the text‑prompted distribution, directly transferring the text baseline’s behavior (our text F1 is good: Llama ≈ 0.80, Qwen ≈ 0.85).
- **Per‑channel affine + tiny MLP** add just enough expressiveness to correct directional/shape mismatches that scalar RMS cannot fix; this is a common failure mode behind “function‑word first token” degeneration.
- **Eval nudges** remove decode‑time headwinds so training gains show up immediately, improving stakeholder confidence while the new losses converge.

#### Expected acceptance signals
- **FirstTok@1** should move from ~3–6% into the teens (Top‑5 into the 30–40% range).
- Degenerate "the/of/and" first tokens largely disappear in the debug print.
- Latent F1/EM increase materially above the token‑budget baseline (currently ~0.04 F1 for Llama), trending toward the text counterpart.

#### Implementation notes (concise)
- **K-step CE under latent prefix (teacher forcing)**
  ```python
  K = 4
  loss_kce = sum(F.cross_entropy(logits_latent[:, t, :], y_gold[:, t]) for t in range(K)) / K
  loss = loss_main + λ_first*first_token_ce + λ_kce*loss_kce    ```

### 2025-09-22 — Stage C eval crash (chat literal)

- **Error:** `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'strip_literal' referenced before assignment` during Stage C evaluation.
- **Cause:** The chat-mode prompt path stripped the `Answer: ` literal and attempted to reattach it before the literal was initialised in the anchor loop.
- **Fix:** Initialise the literal once (from `config.json` or the default) before building `anchor_info`, then reuse it when constructing prompts and anchors. Evaluation now completes and text baselines recover.

### 2025-09-22 — Stage A warm-up & chat-template baseline repair

- **Pipeline update:** `run_scoped_softprompt_multi.sh` now performs a Stage A latent fit (encoder + adapters unfrozen) before the scoped Stage B prefix training, saving the first pass to `ckpt/stageA` and resuming from it with the encoder frozen. This prevents Stage B from starting with random latents.
- **Training sanity:** `_assert_t0_alignment` skips its check when chat templates are active, eliminating false warnings about first-token mismatches under templated prompts.
- **Evaluation fix:** `format_with_chat_template` always routes through the tokenizer’s own chat template and appends `"Answer: "` afterward, so text baselines retain model-specific headers instead of falling back to plain “Assistant:” scaffolds.
- **Post-mortem:** The initial Stage C rerun still showed zero text EM/F1 because we reloaded prefix-tuning adapters *before* computing text baselines. Evaluation now measures text prompts using the raw base checkpoints and only attaches prefix adapters afterwards for latent runs.

### 2025-09-22 — Stage A instability (fix)

- Stage A gradients were spiking into the 500–800 range, starving the latent encoder of real progress. We made clipping the default (`--max_grad_norm=1.0`) in `latentwire/train.py` and reduced the Stage A/Stage B first-token + K-token weights in `scripts/run_scoped_softprompt_multi.sh` to stabilise optimisation. These knobs apply automatically for future runs; setting `--max_grad_norm <= 0` still disables clipping for experiments.
- Stage B now keeps the encoder trainable while prefix-tuning so the warmed-up latent model can continue improving instead of freezing at a random initialisation.
- Enabled a gentle cosine schedule for the first-token CE (peaks capped at 2.5/3.0) and turned on KD for the first K steps in both Stage A and Stage B. This keeps gradients in check while distilling the text baseline into the latent path during smoke runs, giving the latent wire a fighting chance before the hero sweep.
- Stage B now resumes from Stage A weights with `--reset_epoch`, so we reuse the learned latent encoder without inheriting Stage A's epoch counter; each stage now cleanly runs its own four epochs.
- Stage B no longer freezes the encoder; instead we resume from Stage A, reset the epoch counter, drop the first-token peak slightly (2.2), and lower the LR (5e-5) so the encoder and prefix continue to improve together without blowing up gradients.
- Both stages now add light state-KD (`state_kd_weight=0.1`) and use a lower LR (`5e-5`) so the latent prefix is nudged toward the text teacher’s early-layer activations during smoke runs; this should move first-token losses faster and reduce the need for ad-hoc tuning before the hero sweep.
- Default smoke runs now keep Stage A at 4 epochs but extend Stage B to 6 (hero: 6/10), export `TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false`, and disable `use_cache` in eval, which clears the repeated tokenizer/past-key warnings in the logs.
- Stage B now trains on a larger sampled subset (default 1.3k vs 640) while Stage A keeps the smaller 640 batch; the extra data plus longer epoch budget should help the prefix/encoder continue to improve during smoke runs before we scale to hero configurations.
- Stage C now evaluates with a mild prefix gain (`1.1`) to counteract under‑scaling during decode; this will be our default until the latent first-token accuracy stabilises.
- Stage A starts with latent dropout (`keep_start=0.7`) and Stage B starts even lower (`0.5`), annealing to 1.0; combined with state KD it mixes teacher tokens into the latent path early on so first-token learning no longer stalls.
- **Next intervention plan (latent acceptance):**
  1. **Mixed text/latent warm-up.** For the first Stage B epoch alternate batches between text teacher forcing and latent-prefix teacher forcing. This injects clean gold scaffolds at the moment the encoder/adapters are most fragile, which should push first-token top‑1 into double digits and kick latent F1 off the floor.
  2. **Shared + per-model latent slices w/ deeper adapters.** Split `latent_len` into `[shared || llama_private || qwen_private]` (e.g., 32→20/6/6) and upgrade adapters to 2-layer MLPs with residual. This gives each model enough dedicated bandwidth to interpret the shared wire without fighting the other, particularly important because Qwen’s first-token acceptance remains 0%.
  3. **Tiny LoRA fallback.** If the above still leaves latent F1 >10 points behind text, attach r=4 LoRA to the first 4 attention blocks on each LLM. This keeps the story scoped while letting the models learn how to read the latent prefix instead of being purely frozen.
  4. **Parallel Llama/Qwen passes.** Once latent learning is healthy, run both LLM updates concurrently (Accelerate or manual threading) so all four GPUs are busy; that roughly halves turn-around time for smoke sweeps and hero runs.
- **Next steps:** Re-run Stage A→Stage B→Stage C to confirm text EM/F1 recover, then inspect latent metrics with the warmed-up wire.

### 2025-09-25 — Single-model warm-up + runner (today)

- Added optional model selection to `latentwire/train.py` (`--models` now honours `llama`/`qwen` subsets) so we can train a single backend without loading the other 7B checkpoint. Checkpoint loading/saving now adapts to whichever adapters are present.
- Implemented the Stage B text↔latent warm-up (controlled via `--warmup_text_latent_steps` / `--warmup_text_latent_epochs`). When enabled we alternate full-text and latent teacher forcing for the initial steps; logging now tags each batch `L` (latent) or `T` (text) so we can verify the schedule.
- Updated `scripts/run_scoped_softprompt_multi.sh` to enable a one-epoch warm-up during Stage B, and added `scripts/run_llama_single.sh` for the Llama-only pipeline (Stage A/B/C). The new runner defaults to smoke-sized budgets and accepts `--hero` for longer sweeps.
- Known issue: `pytest -q` currently fails on this workstation because Torch cannot locate `libtorch_cpu.dylib` in the host Anaconda env; rerun inside the project venv/conda env before publishing results.
- Fixed a regression spotted in the latest smoke logs where Stage A aborted with an `IndentationError` (`state_blob` block in `latentwire/train.py`). The periodic checkpoint save now has the correct indentation and we only emit the warm-anchor metadata once per checkpoint record.
- Warm-up now includes an explicit embedding-alignment term: during text-mode steps we match the first few gold answer embeddings (default 4 tokens, weight 0.5) against the adapter output. Both `scripts/run_scoped_softprompt_multi.sh` and `scripts/run_llama_single.sh` wire the new `--warmup_align_tokens/--warmup_align_weight` knobs so the gradient actually reaches the encoder/adapters instead of only exercising the frozen teachers.
- Alignment now skips any leading BOS tokens when computing the warm-up loss so single-token answers still contribute signal; the warm-up path also adds a teacher-forced cross-entropy term during text batches and logs those warm-up steps so we can track `align`/`text_tf` in real time. Stage C summary reports “joint” metrics as `n/a` when only one model is active.
- Upgraded the per-model adapters to a residual two-layer MLP and bumped the single-model runner defaults (`adapter_hidden_mult=4`, `adapter_dropout=0.1`, `latent_private_len=16`). Warm-up now runs for three epochs with stronger alignment/teacher weights (`warmup_text_latent_epochs=3`, `warmup_align_weight=1.5`, `warmup_text_teacher_weight=2.5`) and a 50% tail probability so the adapter keeps seeing teacher-forced batches longer; latent losses on those batches are down-weighted (`warmup_text_latent_weight=0.0`) and the warm-up window is now pure text (no alternating latent batches).
- Default device maps in `run_llama_single.sh` and the multi-model runner stay on HuggingFace's `auto` setting; to encourage a more even split across the listed GPUs set `GPU_MEM_GIB` (e.g., `GPU_MEM_GIB=60`) before launching or override `LLAMA_DEVICE_MAP`/`QWEN_DEVICE_MAP` manually.
- Evaluation now respects the active model subset when loading the encoder (fixes STQuery checkpoints produced with private latent slices for single-model runs).
