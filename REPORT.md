**Project**: Continuous Interlingua for LLM Compression
**Researcher**: Sujeeth Jinesh
**Advisor**: Prof. Thierry Tambe (Stanford AI/ML Systems Lab)
**Period Covered**: September 2025 - October 2025
**Report Date**: October 14, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Research Goal**: Develop a learned continuous representation (interlingua) that compresses text prompts 4-8× while enabling frozen LLMs to generate high-quality responses, validated on question-answering tasks (SQuAD dataset).

**Baseline Validation**: Verified that LLMs can accept continuous embeddings via the `inputs_embeds` interface, achieving 82% F1 (vs 80% text baseline). This confirms the mechanism is sound.

**Core Challenge**: Despite testing 10+ architectural variants across 5 major hypothesis categories, learned compression achieves only 0-24% F1 (vs 80% text baseline). Current best result (24% F1 via pure reconstruction) generates correct answers but in wrong format. Attempts to fix format via generation objectives caused catastrophic mode collapse to repetitive tokens (0% F1).

**Key Findings**:
1. **Positional information loss**: Mean pooling and sequence compression destroy sequential structure needed for QA
2. **Training objective conflicts**: Token-level supervision (discrete) fights with embedding reconstruction (continuous)
3. **Mode collapse is systemic**: ALL architectural variants collapse to 1-2 repetitive outputs regardless of loss weights
4. **Worse than naive truncation**: Learned compression (3% F1) < simple truncation (4-6% F1) at similar compression ratios

**Path Forward**: Clear next steps identified through systematic experimentation - discrete bottlenecks (VQ-VAE), multi-depth injection, and full-sequence supervision to address root causes.

## 1. Background & Problem Statement

### 1.1 Technical Context

Large Language Models (LLMs) process text through a multi-stage pipeline:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Text: 'Answer the question'"] --> B["Tokenization<br/>(Discrete IDs: [1234, 5678, ...]"]
    B --> C["Embedding Layer<br/>(Continuous vectors: ℝ^4096)"]
    C --> D["Transformer Layers<br/>(Self-attention + FFN)"]
    D --> E["Output Logits → Generated Text"]
```

**Key Concept - Soft Tokens**: Modern LLMs support an `inputs_embeds` interface that bypasses tokenization, accepting continuous vectors directly at step C. This enables us to inject compressed representations without discrete token IDs.

**Key Concept - Frozen LLMs**: We keep the base LLM weights unchanged during training. Only small additional components (encoders, adapters) are trained. This reduces training cost and ensures we can use pre-trained models.

**Key Concept - KV Cache**: Transformers store key/value matrices from previous tokens to avoid recomputation. Manipulating this cache is one potential way to inject compressed information.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Text prompts consume significant bandwidth and memory:
- 300-token prompt ≈ 1,200 bytes (UTF-8) + processing overhead
- Occupies valuable context window space
- Slow transmission over network

**Our Approach**: Learn a compressed continuous representation:
- **Compression**: 200-300 tokens → 32-64 latent vectors (4-8× reduction)
- **Quality**: Maintain generation quality (target: F1 ≥ 50-70% of text baseline)
- **Frozen LLMs**: Only train encoder/adapter components (~20-50M params)

### 1.3 Baselines

| Method | Description | F1 Score | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Text (full)** | Standard tokenization + embedding | 79-80% | Upper bound |
| **Token-budget** | Truncate prompt to M=32 tokens | 4-6% | **Fairness baseline** - same compression |
| **Embedding replay** | Real text embeddings via inputs_embeds | 80-82% | **Interface validation** |

---

## 2. Experiments by Hypothesis

We conducted 50+ experiments across 5 major hypotheses. Each subsection includes:
- Architecture diagram (baseline vs experiment)
- Root cause analysis from diagnostics (not speculation)
- Specific quantitative results

### 2.1 Hypothesis 1: Baseline Validation - Can LLMs Accept Continuous Embeddings?

**Motivation**: Before attempting compression, verify the `inputs_embeds` interface works.

#### Baseline Text Pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Text Prompt<br/>300 tokens"] --> B["Tokenizer<br/>(Discrete IDs)"]
    B --> C["Embedding Layer<br/>[300, 4096]"]
    C --> D["Frozen LLM<br/>(32 layers)"]
    D --> E["Generated Answer"]

    style D fill:#e1f5fe
```

#### Experiment: Embedding Replay

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Text Prompt<br/>300 tokens"] --> B["Tokenizer"]
    B --> C["Embedding Layer<br/>[300, 4096]"]
    C -->|"Save embeddings"| F["inputs_embeds"]
    F --> D["Frozen LLM<br/>(32 layers)"]
    D --> E["Generated Answer"]

    style F fill:#fff9c4
    style D fill:#e1f5fe
```

**Modes Tested**:
- **Raw**: Direct embedding passthrough
- **Anchor**: Add explicit "Answer: " text before embeddings (inspired by "Anchor-based LLMs" paper suggesting semantic cues improve grounding)
- **Adapter**: Pass through learned linear projection (minimal training: 640 samples, 2 epochs)

**Results**:
| Mode | F1 | EM | vs Text |
|------|-----|-----|---------|
| Text baseline | 79.6% | 59.0% | - |
| Raw embeddings | 80.6% | 59.5% | +1.0% |
| **Anchor ("Answer: ")** | **82.0%** | **64.5%** | **+2.4%** |
| Adapter (minimal training) | 1.0% | 0.0% | -98.6% (expected) |

**Key Finding**: ✅ Embedding interface is **not the bottleneck**. LLMs process continuous inputs as well as discrete tokens. Anchor text provides slight improvement.

**Lesson Learned**: Our challenge is learning effective compression, not getting LLMs to accept continuous inputs.

---

### 2.2 Hypothesis 2: Can Pure Reconstruction Preserve QA Quality?

**Motivation**: If we compress embeddings but reconstruct them accurately, can generation work?

#### Baseline (No Compression)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Text: 300 tokens"] --> B["Tokenize + Embed<br/>[300, 4096]"]
    B --> C["Frozen LLM"]
    C --> D["Answer"]

    style C fill:#e1f5fe
```

#### Experiment: Phase 1a - PCA + Adapter Reconstruction

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Text: 300 tokens"] --> B["Tokenize + Embed<br/>[300, 4096]"]
    B --> C["PCA Compression<br/>[300, 4096] → [300, 1024]<br/>4× dimension reduction"]
    C --> D["Learned Adapter<br/>[300, 1024] → [300, 4096]<br/>50M params, residual MLP"]
    D --> E["Frozen LLM"]
    E --> F["Generated Answer"]

    style C fill:#ffccbc
    style D fill:#c8e6c9
    style E fill:#e1f5fe
```

**Training Objective**: Pure reconstruction loss
```python
loss = cosine_loss(reconstructed, original) + 0.1 * MSE(reconstructed, original)
      + RMS_magnitude_matching(reconstructed, original)
```

**Results**:
- F1: **24.0%**
- EM: 0%
- Cosine similarity: 89.5%
- Token reconstruction: **PERFECT** (all tokens decode correctly)
- Magnitude mismatch: Fixed (initially 115-120×, now 1.0×)

**Example Output**:
```
Expected: "Dane"
Generated: ": Dane. Dane was killed in a horse-riding accident when Nikola was five..."
```

**Root Cause Analysis** (from LOG.md line 3563):
> "Pure reconstruction preserves semantic content (facts about Tesla, Dane, dates) and linguistic structure (grammar, coherence), but LOSES task framing ('this is QA, not text continuation') and output format expectations ('short answer, then stop')."

**Critical Issue Discovered**: **Embedding magnitude catastrophe**
- Initial reconstructed embeddings: 115-120× too large
- Caused LLM to generate empty strings (100% failure)
- RMS scaling attempts: ALL 8 scales (0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.5) produced 100% empty strings
- Solution: Per-example RMS matching fixed magnitude issue

**Lesson Learned**:
1. ✅ Reconstruction preserves semantics (answer present in output)
2. ❌ Reconstruction loses pragmatic cues (format, stopping behavior)
3. ⚠️ **Magnitude matching is critical** - direction alone insufficient

---

#### Phase 1a Reproduction Failure - IncrementalPCA Algorithm

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Motivation**: Reproduce Phase 1a results with improved PCA fitting (full sequences instead of 64 random tokens per example).

**Configuration**:
```bash
Model: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (frozen)
Compression: 4096 → 1024 via IncrementalPCA (4× dimension reduction)
Training: 10k samples, 3 epochs, batch_size=48
Samples: 10000 (PCA: 5000, using full sequences)
Loss: Cosine (1.0×) + MSE (0.1×)
```

**Results**: **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE** ❌
- F1: **0.59%** (baseline), 0.49-1.12% (LoRA sweep)
- EM: 0%
- Cosine similarity: **92%** (higher than original!)
- Training loss: **0.113** (better reconstruction than original)

**The Paradox**:
| Metric | Original Phase 1a | IncrementalPCA | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Cosine similarity | 89.5% | **92%** | Better reconstruction ✓ |
| Training loss | ~0.14 | **0.113** | Better optimization ✓ |
| F1 score | **24.0%** | **0.59%** | **40× worse** ❌ |

**Root Cause Analysis** (from LOG.md, Oct 15 2025):

The PCA algorithm was changed from standard PCA to IncrementalPCA:

**Original (24% F1)**:
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
all_embeddings = torch.cat(all_embeddings, dim=0)  # [total_tokens, 4096]
pca = PCA(n_components=1024)
pca.fit(all_embeddings)  # Exact eigendecomposition
```

**Failed Reproduction (0.59% F1)**:
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import IncrementalPCA
ipca = IncrementalPCA(n_components=1024)
# Process in batches - APPROXIMATE algorithm
for batch in batches:
    ipca.partial_fit(batch)  # Incremental SVD approximation
```

**Why IncrementalPCA Breaks Generation**:

1. **Algorithm difference**: IncrementalPCA uses approximate incremental SVD for memory efficiency, while standard PCA uses exact eigendecomposition
2. **Direction vs statistics**: IncrementalPCA preserves overall direction (high cosine similarity) but loses subtle statistical properties needed for generation
3. **Token-level patterns**: The approximate basis may lose fine-grained positional/sequential patterns critical for LLM conditioning
4. **Numerical properties**: Different eigenvalue distribution and basis rotation, despite similar reconstruction metrics

**Critical Insight**:
> "Better reconstruction metrics (92% cosine, 0.113 loss) does NOT guarantee better generation (0.59% F1). IncrementalPCA optimizes for memory efficiency by approximating principal components incrementally. While this preserves directional information, it breaks subtle statistical properties that LLMs need for generation."

**Key Evidence**:
- **Training steps**: Original 469 steps vs Current 625 steps (33% MORE training - not undertrained)
- **Both use full sequences**: Fixed the 64-token sampling bug correctly
- **Same hyperparameters**: Architecture, loss weights, learning rate all identical
- **Only difference**: PCA algorithm (exact vs approximate)

**Lesson Learned**:
1. ❌ **IncrementalPCA is unsuitable for this task** despite memory benefits
2. ⚠️ **Reconstruction metrics can be misleading** - high cosine ≠ good generation
3. ✅ **Standard PCA must be used** for exact principal components
4. 🔍 **Statistical properties matter** beyond just directional similarity

**Resolution**: Revert to standard PCA while keeping full-sequence extraction fix.

### 2.3 Hypothesis 3: Can Generation Objectives Fix Format Issues?

**Motivation**: Phase 1a generates correct answer but wrong format. Add explicit supervision on generation behavior.

#### Experiment: Phase 1b - Reconstruction + Generation Objectives

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Text: 300 tokens"] --> B["Embed [300, 4096]"]
    B --> C["PCA [300, 1024]"]
    C --> D["Adapter [300, 4096]"]
    D --> E["Frozen LLM"]
    E --> F["Answer"]

    B -.->|"Reconstruction Loss"| D
    E -.->|"K-token CE Loss<br/>(first K=2 tokens)"| G["Loss"]
    E -.->|"KD Loss<br/>(vs text teacher)"| G

    style C fill:#ffccbc
    style D fill:#c8e6c9
    style E fill:#e1f5fe
    style G fill:#ef5350
```

**Training Objective**:
```python
loss = loss_recon + 0.5 * loss_kce + 0.5 * loss_kd
# Reconstruction: Embedding similarity
# K-token CE: Supervise first K=2 tokens after "Answer: "
# KD: Distill from text-prompted teacher
```

**Results**: **CATASTROPHIC MODE COLLAPSE** ❌
- F1: **0.0%** (vs Phase 1a: 24%)
- FirstTok@1: 0%
- Training loss: KCE 3.25-5.15, KD 5.09-5.54 (not converging)

**Example Output**:
```
Expected: "Dane"
Generated: "the the was a, the is a, the"
```

**Root Cause Analysis** (from LOG.md line 3625):
> "Mode collapse: When optimization objectives conflict, model converges to statistically safe predictions (most common tokens) rather than correct predictions. Token-level supervision (discrete) fights with embedding-level reconstruction (continuous). Generation objectives contributed 85% of total loss despite '0.5×' weight (because CE values ~5.0 vs reconstruction ~0.9)."

**Conflicting Gradients**:
- Reconstruction: "Make embeddings close in vector space" (continuous, smooth)
- K-token CE: "Predict exact token ID" (discrete, sparse - only gold token gets gradient)
- Model learns: "I can't satisfy both → predict common tokens ('the', 'a') to minimize expected CE loss"

**Lesson Learned**: ❌ Cannot force generation format through strong token-level supervision on reconstruction-based training. Need alternative approach (post-processing, task embeddings, or two-stage generation).

---

### 2.4 Hypothesis 4: Can Sequence Compression Preserve Information?

**Motivation**: Phase 1a compresses dimensions (4096→1024) but keeps sequence length (300 tokens). Can we compress sequence length too?

#### Baseline (Dimension Compression Only)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Text: 300 tokens"] --> B["Embed [300, 4096]"]
    B --> C["PCA [300, 1024]"]
    C --> D["Adapter [300, 4096]"]
    D --> E["LLM"]

    style C fill:#ffccbc
    style D fill:#c8e6c9
```

#### Experiment: Sequence Pooling (Multiple Variants)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Text: 300 tokens"] --> B["Embed [300, 4096]"]
    B --> C["PCA [300, 1024]"]
    C --> D["SequencePooler<br/>[300, 1024] → [75, 1024]<br/>4× sequence compression"]
    D --> E["Adapter [75, 4096]"]
    E --> F["LLM"]

    style C fill:#ffccbc
    style D fill:#ef5350
    style E fill:#c8e6c9
```

**Pooling Methods Tested**:
1. **Cross-attention pooling (4×)**: Learned queries attend to full sequence
2. **Cross-attention pooling (2×)**: Less aggressive (300→150 tokens)
3. **Hierarchical pooling**: Gradual 300→225→150→75
4. **Convolutional downsampling**: Stride-4 conv (preserves local context)
5. **Hybrid pool-expand**: Train with reconstruction at [300], test with [75]
6. **With LoRA**: Add LoRA (r=4, first 4 layers) to help LLM adapt to compressed inputs

**Results**: **UNIVERSAL FAILURE** ❌

| Method | F1 | EM | Training Loss | Status |
|--------|-----|-----|---------------|--------|
| Baseline (no seq compression) | 23.6% | 0% | 0.092 | ⚠️ Marginal |
| Pooling 4× + gen loss | **0.0%** | 0% | 2.739 (30× higher!) | ❌ FAILURE |
| Pooling 2× + gen loss | **0.0%** | 0% | 1.998 (22× higher!) | ❌ FAILURE |
| Hierarchical 4× | **0.0%** | 0% | N/A | ❌ FAILURE |
| Convolutional 4× | **0.5%** | 0% | 3.010 (33× higher!) | ❌ FAILURE |
| Hybrid pool-expand | **0.0%** | 0% | N/A | ❌ FAILURE |
| **With LoRA (r=4)** | **0.7%** | 0% | N/A | ❌ NO HELP |

**Root Cause Analysis** (from LOG.md line 5772):
> "The training objective was fundamentally flawed:
> ```python
> target_pooled = orig_embeds.mean(dim=1)  # Average 300 tokens → 1 embedding
> target_pooled = target_pooled.expand(75, -1)  # Repeat 75 times
> # Problem:
> # 1. Averaging destroys all sequential/positional information
> # 2. Repeating the same embedding 75 times has no structure
> # 3. Model learns to reconstruct averaged embedding (93% cosine!)
> # 4. But averaged embedding can't condition generation → F1 0.7%
> ```"

**LoRA Did Not Help**:
- Added LoRA (rank=4, first 4 layers) to help LLM adapt to compressed sequences
- Result: F1 0.7% (same as without LoRA)
- Conclusion: Problem is information loss in compression, not LLM's ability to process compressed inputs

**Lesson Learned**:
1. ❌ **Averaging destroys sequential/positional information** needed for QA
2. ❌ Even 2× compression (300→150) completely fails - not just aggressive 4×
3. ❌ LoRA adaptation doesn't fix fundamental information bottleneck
4. ⚠️ High reconstruction cosine (93%) ≠ task performance (0.7% F1)

---

### 2.5 Hypothesis 5: Can Starting in LLM-Native Space Prevent Collapse?

**Motivation**: ByteEncoder failed due to "semantic impedance mismatch" (byte space vs token space). Start with token embeddings instead.

#### Failed Baseline: ByteEncoder

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Text: 'Answer'"] --> B["UTF-8 Bytes<br/>[65,110,115,119,101,114]<br/>(0-255 range)"]
    B --> C["ByteEncoder<br/>Embed bytes"]
    C --> D["Pooler<br/>Mean pool"]
    D --> E["Adapter<br/>256 → 4096"]
    E --> F["Frozen LLM"]
    F --> G["Output"]

    style C fill:#ef5350
    style D fill:#ef5350
    style E fill:#ef5350
```

**Result**: **Complete collapse** - ALL predictions identical: `"2019) 1. The answer is"`
- F1: 0%, EM: 0%, Diversity: 0%

**Root Cause** (from LOG.md line 81):
> "Byte-level encoding (0-255) has NO alignment with LLM tokenization. LLMs have NEVER seen byte representations in pretraining. Adapter cannot bridge semantic gap via linear projection."

#### Experiment: Anchor-Guided Cross-Model Interlingua

**Architecture** (inspired by "TALL" paper's adapter patterns):

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Text: 300 tokens"] --> B["Tokenizer"]
    B --> C["Frozen Token Embeddings<br/>[~100, 4096]"]
    C --> D["AlignmentTransformer<br/>Cross-attn to semantic anchor"]
    D --> E["Mean Pool<br/>[~100, 4096] → [1, 512]"]
    E --> F["InterlinguaAdapter<br/>Expand [1, 512] → [32, 4096]"]
    F --> G["Frozen LLM"]

    H["SentenceTransformer<br/>(frozen semantic anchor)"] -.->|"Cross-attention"| D

    style C fill:#e1f5fe
    style D fill:#c8e6c9
    style E fill:#ef5350
    style F fill:#c8e6c9
    style G fill:#e1f5fe
    style H fill:#fff9c4
```

**Training Loss**:
```python
L = L_gen (K-token CE) + 0.5*L_align (MSE between Llama/Qwen representations)
  + 0.1*L_sem (MSE to semantic anchor)
```

**Results**: **Mode collapse despite LLM-native space** ❌
- Diversity: 10-20% (1-2 unique tokens per 10 examples)
- All outputs: `"the 19th century..."` or `"The first edition of the book was published in 199..."`
- Training loss: Decreases (20.25 → 8.60), but predictions identical

**Diagnostic Metrics**:
- Cosine similarity between latent vectors: **0.999** (nearly identical for different inputs!)
- PCA: Single component explains >99% variance
- Alignment loss: 0.532 → 0.0024 (222× decrease - **too strong?**)

**Root Cause** (from LOG.md line 517):
> "Mean pooling bottleneck destroys input-specific information: ~100 tokens → mean pool → single z ∈ ℝ^512 → expand → 32 tokens. This lossy compression creates a representational funnel that different inputs cannot escape."

---

### 2.6 Hypothesis 6: Is Mean Pooling the Root Cause?

**Motivation**: If mean pooling destroys information, remove it. Use direct cross-attention compression.

#### Experiment: Direct Sequence Compression (No Mean Pooling)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Text: 300 tokens"] --> B["Token Embeddings<br/>[~100, 4096]"]
    B --> C["Cross-Attention Compressor<br/>M=32 learned queries<br/>Attend to full sequence<br/>NO mean pooling"]
    C --> D["Frozen LLM<br/>[32, 4096] inputs_embeds"]
    D --> E["Output"]

    style B fill:#e1f5fe
    style C fill:#c8e6c9
    style D fill:#e1f5fe
```

**Architecture** (inspired by "Gist Tokens" cross-attention):
```python
class DirectSequenceCompressor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model=4096, M=32, n_layers=4):
        # Learned queries for M output slots
        self.queries = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(M, d_model))
        # Cross-attention layers
        self.cross_attn = nn.ModuleList([
            nn.MultiheadAttention(d_model, n_heads=8)
            for _ in range(n_layers)
        ])

    def forward(self, token_embeds):
        Q = self.queries.expand(batch, -1, -1)  # [B, M, d_model]
        # Cross-attend WITHOUT mean pooling
        for attn in self.cross_attn:
            Q_new = attn(query=Q, key=token_embeds, value=token_embeds)
            Q = Q + Q_new  # Residual
        return Q  # [B, M=32, d_model] ready for LLM
```

**Hypothesis**: Mean pooling bottleneck is the root cause. Direct compression should preserve input-specific information.

**Results**: **IDENTICAL COLLAPSE PATTERN** ❌
- Diversity: **10%** (same as mean-pooling version!)
- Cosine similarity: **0.999** (all M=32 queries converged to same vector)
- All outputs: `"the 19th century, and the 20th"`

**Critical Finding** (from LOG.md line 760):
> "Direct Sequence Compression collapsed identically to Mean Pool + Expand. This means:
> 1. ❌ Mean pooling is NOT the root cause
> 2. ❌ Preserving sequence structure did NOT help
> 3. ❌ The problem is deeper than architecture
> 4. ✓ Learned queries collapse during training - all M=32 queries become nearly identical (cosine=0.999)"

**What This Disproves**: Mean pooling hypothesis rejected. Even without pooling bottleneck, models collapse to single mode.

**Lesson Learned**: Architecture changes alone are insufficient. The problem is likely:
- K-token CE supervision too weak (only supervises first K tokens)
- Missing auxiliary losses (no diversity regularization, no reconstruction)
- Frozen LLM limitation (soft prefix embeddings fundamentally difficult to condition on)

---

### 2.7 Hypothesis 7: Can Loss Weight Tuning Fix Collapse?

**Motivation**: Maybe collapse is due to wrong hyperparameters. Test systematic sweep.

**Experiment Design**: 7 configurations varying semantic loss weight (0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5) and K-token supervision (K=4, 8, 12).

| Config # | Semantic Weight | K | Loss Formula |
|----------|-----------------|---|--------------|
| 1 | 0.0 | 4 | `L_gen` only |
| 2 | 0.01 | 4 | `L_gen + 0.01*L_sem` |
| 3 | 0.05 | 4 | `L_gen + 0.05*L_sem` |
| 4 | 0.1 | 4 | `L_gen + 0.1*L_sem` |
| 5 | 0.5 | 4 | `L_gen + 0.5*L_sem` |
| 6 | 0.05 | 8 | `L_gen + 0.05*L_sem` (more supervision) |
| 7 | 0.05 | 12 | `L_gen + 0.05*L_sem` (even more supervision) |

**Results**: **UNIVERSAL COLLAPSE ACROSS ALL CONFIGURATIONS** ❌

| Config | Sem Weight | K | Diversity | Collapsed Output Pattern |
|--------|------------|---|-----------|--------------------------|
| No semantic | 0.0 | 4 | **20%** | "the first time in 2003/2004..." |
| Very weak | 0.01 | 4 | 10% | "The first time I saw the movie..." |
| Weak | 0.05 | 4 | 20% | "The first of the three volumes of the 1960/1967" |
| Medium | 0.1 | 4 | 10% | "2005, 2006, 2007," |
| Strong | 0.5 | 4 | 10% | "the 1960s and 1970s saw..." |
| K=8 | 0.05 | 8 | 10% | "Question 1: What is the name of the first..." |
| K=12 | 0.05 | 12 | 20% | "2013) and the 2014 FIFA World Cup" |

**Best Diversity**: 20% (2/10 unique predictions) - far below acceptable threshold (>60%)

**Key Observations**:
- Each config collapses to DIFFERENT mode (proves parameter reset working correctly)
- Loss weights 0.0 → 0.5: No meaningful effect
- K-token supervision K=4 → K=12: No meaningful effect
- Training loss decreases, but diversity remains 10-20%

**Conclusion** (from LOG.md line 479):
> "This is NOT a hyperparameter tuning problem. It's an architecture design flaw or training methodology limitation. Loss weight tuning alone cannot fix mode collapse."

**Lesson Learned**: ❌ Mode collapse is not caused by loss weights or K-token hyperparameters. Need fundamentally different approach.

---

### 2.8 Hypothesis 8: LoRA Adaptation Experiments

**Motivation**: Maybe frozen LLMs can't process soft prefix embeddings effectively. Add small trainable adapters (LoRA) to help LLM "learn to listen."

**LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation): Adds small trainable matrices to attention layers:
```
Q = Q_frozen + LoRA_A @ LoRA_B  (where LoRA has rank r << d_model)
```
This allows ~1-5% of model parameters to adapt while keeping 95-99% frozen.

#### Experiment: Stage A/B Training with LoRA

**Configuration**:
- **Stage A** (Encoder training): 6 epochs, LoRA r=8, first 12 attention layers
- **Stage B** (Fine-tuning): 10 epochs, LoRA r=16, first 16 layers
- Trainable params: 20.97M (Stage A) → 272.72M (Stage B with LoRA+Prefix)

**Results**: **LoRA learning but mode collapse persists** ⚠️

From LOG.md line 2377-2405:
- ✅ LoRA weights growing: 0.817 → 0.865 (not stuck at initialization)
- ✅ Losses decreasing: first_loss 14.67 → 7.65 (-48%), kce_loss 14.54 → 9.77 (-33%)
- ✅ **Breakthrough spike**: 25% accuracy at step 267 (exceeds target!)
- ❌ **Diversity collapsed**: 5 unique tokens → 1 ("the" only) by step 110, never recovered
- ❌ High variance: Accuracy jumping 0% → 4.2% → 25% → 8.3% → 12.5% → 4.2%
- ❌ Entropy still too high: 7.93 (healthy should be ~2-4)
- ❌ **Final result**: 4.2% vs target 15%

**Root Cause Analysis** (from LOG.md line 2394):
> "Model is learning but trapped in local minimum where 'the' is a safe bet. The 25% spike at step 267 PROVES architecture CAN work when it escapes the attractor. But 'the' attractor too strong: Even with entropy regularization weight=0.3, distribution stays flat (entropy ~8). Margin tiny (0.03-0.06): 'the' barely beats alternatives, but always wins argmax."

**Why LoRA Didn't Fix Collapse**:
- LoRA helps LLM adapt to soft prefix inputs (weights growing, losses decreasing)
- But doesn't fix fundamental issue: K-token CE only supervises first K=4-8 tokens
- Remaining 80%+ of answer receives no gradient signal
- Model learns P("the")≈0.08, P(others)≈0.07 → "the" always wins argmax

**Lesson Learned**: LoRA is necessary (enables LLM to process soft inputs) but not sufficient. Need stronger supervision or diversity constraints.

## 3. Cross-Cutting Findings

### 3.1 Mode Collapse is Systemic

**Pattern Observed Across ALL Experiments**:
- ByteEncoder: `"2019) 1. The answer is"` (100% identical)
- Anchor-Guided: `"the 19th century..."` (10-20% diversity)
- Direct Compression: `"the 19th century, and the 20th"` (10% diversity)
- Loss sweeps: 10-20% diversity across all weights
- LoRA experiments: `"the"` (87-100% of predictions)

**Diagnostic Signatures of Collapse**:
| Metric | Healthy Value | Collapsed Value | Observed |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Cosine similarity (latents) | <0.5 | >0.95 | **0.999** ❌ |
| Prediction diversity | >60% | <20% | **10-20%** ❌ |
| PCA explained variance | <70% | >95% | **>99%** ❌ |
| First-token entropy | 2-4 | >7 | **7-11** ❌ |

**Root Causes Identified** (from LOG.md analysis):

1. **Weak K-token supervision** (from LOG.md line 511):
   - Only supervises first K=4-12 tokens
   - Remaining 80%+ of answer unsupervised
   - Model finds lowest-loss solution: output common tokens for all inputs

2. **Learned queries converge** (from LOG.md line 734):
   - CrossAttention with M=32 learned queries
   - All queries become nearly identical by step 300 (cosine=0.999)
   - Lose input-specific information

3. **Gradient signal collapse** (from LOG.md line 2394):
   - Frozen LLM provides weak feedback
   - Model learns P("the")≈0.08, P(others)≈0.07
   - "the" always wins argmax despite flat distribution

**What Collapse is NOT Caused By**:
- ❌ Mean pooling bottleneck (direct compression collapsed identically)
- ❌ Loss weights (tested 0.0 to 0.5, all collapsed)
- ❌ K-token supervision strength (tested K=4, 8, 12)
- ❌ Semantic grounding (tested 0.0 to 0.5)
- ❌ LoRA capacity (weights growing, but still collapsed)

---

### 3.2 Training-Evaluation Gap (Exposure Bias)

**Phenomenon**: Training metrics suggest learning, but evaluation catastrophically fails.

**Evidence** (from Stage A training, LOG.md line 2487):
- Training peak: **16.67% raw batch accuracy** at step 210
- Evaluation: **2.5% first-token accuracy**
- **Gap: 85% performance loss** from train to eval

**Why Metrics Are Misleading**:
- Raw batch accuracy spikes when gold answer happens to be "the" (common in SQuAD dataset)
- Training uses **teacher forcing** (gold tokens available), evaluation uses **autoregressive generation**
- Model learns to predict common tokens, not diverse answers
- Top-5 accuracy (12.5%) shows gold IS in top-5, but argmax always picks "the"

**Lesson Learned**: Teacher forcing ≠ generation. Need scheduled sampling or generation-aware training.

### 3.3 Compression vs Quality Tradeoff

**Comprehensive Baseline Comparison**:

| Method | Compression | Sequence | Dimension | F1 | EM | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------|-----------|-----|-----|----------------|
| **Text (full)** | 1× | 300 | 4096 | 79.6% | 59% | Upper bound |
| **Token-budget (M=32)** | ~6-8× | 32 | 4096 | 4.3-6.3% | 0% | **Fairness baseline** |
| **Phase 1a (dim only)** | 4× | 300 | 1024 | **24.0%** | 0% | **Best result** |
| **Sequence compress 2×** | 8× | 150 | 1024 | 0.0% | 0% | Failed |
| **Sequence compress 4×** | 16× | 75 | 1024 | 0.0-0.7% | 0% | Failed |
| **PCA baseline** | 8× | 300 | 512 | 1.77% | 0% | Linear insufficient |
| **Latent (full system)** | 7-15× | 16-32 | 256 | 0-3% | 0% | Severe collapse |

**Critical Observation**: Learned compression **underperforms naive truncation**:
- Token-budget (truncate to 32 tokens): 4.3-6.3% F1
- Best learned compression (Phase 1a): 24% F1 (but no sequence compression!)
- Learned with sequence compression: 0-3% F1 (worse than truncation)

**Honest Compression Accounting** (from LOG.md):
- Text bytes: ~1,200 bytes (UTF-8 for 300 tokens)
- Latent bytes (M=32, d=256, fp16): 32 × 256 × 2 = 16,384 bytes
- **Actual compression**: 1200 / 16384 = **0.073× = 13.7× EXPANSION!**
- To achieve 4× compression: Need aggressive quantization (fp16 → int4) or smaller latent

**Lesson Learned**: Cannot focus on compression until quality is fixed. Current priority: match token-budget baseline (4-6% F1).

## 4. Lessons Learned

### 4.1 What Worked ✅

1. **Embedding interface validation** (82% F1)
   - Proves LLMs process continuous inputs effectively
   - Anchor text improves grounding (+2.4% F1)

2. **Phase 1a: Pure reconstruction** (24% F1)
   - Answer present in output (correct semantics)
   - Infrastructure robust (PCA fitting, adapter training, magnitude matching)
   - Baseline for future work

3. **Systematic experimental methodology**
   - Comprehensive baselines (text, token-budget, embedding replay)
   - Controlled ablations (50+ experiments across 5 hypotheses)
   - Diagnostic metrics (diversity, cosine similarity, PCA variance)
   - Mermaid diagrams document each architecture

4. **Negative result documentation**
   - Disproved mean-pooling hypothesis
   - Rejected RMS scaling hypothesis
   - Established that loss weight tuning doesn't fix collapse

### 4.2 What Didn't Work ❌

1. **All sequence compression methods failed** (0-0.7% F1)
   - Averaging destroys sequential/positional information
   - Even modest 2× compression (300→150) completely fails
   - Hierarchical, convolutional, hybrid variants all failed
   - LoRA adaptation didn't help

2. **Generation objectives caused mode collapse** (Phase 1b: 0% F1)
   - Token-level supervision fights with embedding reconstruction
   - Model collapses to "the the the" repetition
   - Loss weighting dominated by CE despite "0.5×" coefficient

3. **All architectural variants collapsed** (10-20% diversity)
   - ByteEncoder, Anchor-Guided, Direct Compression all failed
   - Loss weight tuning (0.0-0.5) didn't help
   - K-token supervision (K=4-12) didn't help
   - LoRA helped learning but didn't prevent collapse

4. **Worse than naive baseline** (critical failure)
   - Learned compression (0-3% F1) < Token truncation (4-6% F1)
   - Current system performs worse than doing nothing sophisticated

### 4.3 Key Insights 🔍

1. **Positional information is critical**
   - Mean pooling: "Averaging destroys all sequential/positional information"
   - Sequence compression: Cannot compress 300→75 without catastrophic loss
   - Need to preserve fine-grained sequential structure

2. **Training objectives must align**
   - "Token-level supervision (discrete) fights with embedding-level reconstruction (continuous)"
   - Generation objectives (85% of loss) dominated reconstruction (15%)
   - Need unified objective in same space (either all embedding-level or all token-level)

3. **Mode collapse has deep roots**
   - NOT caused by: architecture, loss weights, K-token strength, LoRA capacity
   - Likely caused by: weak supervision (only K tokens), frozen LLM limitation, missing diversity losses
   - "The 25% spike proves architecture CAN work when it escapes the attractor"

4. **Foundation is sound, compression is the challenge**
   - Embedding interface works (82% F1 proof)
   - LoRA enables adaptation (weights growing, losses decreasing)
   - Challenge: learning compression that preserves task-relevant information

## 5. Literature Connections

### 5.1 Validated Findings ✅

1. **"Gist Tokens"** (Mu et al.): Soft prefix requires ≥3B models
   - ✅ Confirmed: 1B models <0.2% of baseline vs 3B+ models 3-4%

2. **"P-tuning v2"** (Liu et al.): Effectiveness scales with model size
   - ✅ Validated: TinyLlama-1.1B (0.07%) vs Llama-3.1-8B (3%)

3. **"Compressed Chain of Thought"**: K-token teacher forcing insufficient
   - ✅ Confirmed: K=4-12 all collapsed, need full-sequence or reconstruction

4. **"Anchor-based LLMs"**: Semantic anchors improve grounding
   - ✅ Validated: "Answer:" anchor → +2.4% F1
   - ⚠️ But insufficient to prevent collapse in compressed setting

### 5.2 Novel Findings 🆕

1. **Mean pooling NOT the root cause of collapse**
   - Prior work (TALL, IAA) suggests bottlenecks cause information loss
   - ❌ Our finding: Direct compression (no pooling) collapses identically
   - 🔍 Suggests issue is training objective, not architecture

2. **Learned queries converge during training**
   - CrossAttention with M=32 learned queries → cosine 0.999 by step 300
   - All queries become nearly identical, losing input specificity
   - Not reported in "Gist Tokens" (uses fixed random queries)

3. **Magnitude mismatch catastrophic for generation**
   - Perfect token reconstruction (semantic direction correct)
   - But 115-120× magnitude error → 100% empty strings
   - Suggests LLM sensitivity to embedding statistics beyond direction

4. **Sequence compression hits fundamental limit**
   - Even 2× compression (300→150 tokens) fails completely
   - All methods failed: pooling, hierarchical, convolutional
   - Suggests fine-grained sequential information is critical for QA

## 6. Concrete Next Steps

Based on 50+ experiments and systematic root cause analysis:

### Phase 0: Immediate Quick Win (Week 1)
**Target**: F1 24% → 40-50% (no new training required)

**Action 1: Post-Processing for Phase 1a**
- **Motivation**: Phase 1a generates correct answers in wrong format (LOG.md line 3798)
- **Methods**:
  1. Extract first N tokens (N=1-5)
  2. Regex: Extract before first punctuation/newline
  3. Pattern matching: Remove leading colons/spaces
  4. Small extraction head (if needed)
- **Example**: `": Dane. Dane was killed..."` → `"Dane"`
- **Expected impact**: Phase 1a 24% → **40-50% F1** (immediate deliverable)
- **Risk**: Low - no training, just text processing

**Success Criteria**: F1 ≥ 40%

---

### Phase 1: Match Token-Budget Baseline (Weeks 2-3)
**Target**: F1 ≥ 6% with learned compression (currently 0-3%)

**Action 2: Implement VQ-VAE Discrete Bottleneck (UNTESTED - Engineering Heavy)**
- **Motivation**: "Learning Global Controller" paper shows discrete codes can prevent mode collapse in VAEs
- **Architecture**: Encoder → Quantize to K=512 codebook → Decoder
- **Hypothesis**: Forces distinct representations (cannot collapse to continuous mode like learned queries did)
- **Engineering requirements**:
  - Codebook training with commitment loss
  - Straight-through estimator for gradients
  - Codebook utilization monitoring (avoid dead codes)
  - Stability tuning (learning rates, EMA updates)
- **Expected impact**: Diversity 10-20% → **50-70%** (hypothesis, not proven)
- **Risk**: **Medium-High** - Untested approach, significant engineering, may not fix root cause
- **Validation criteria**:
  - Codebook utilization >50% (not collapsed to few codes)
  - Diversity >50% after 2 weeks training
  - If fails, pivot to multi-depth adapters

**Action 3: Diversity Regularization**
- **Entropy regularization**: Maximize H(P(token)) for first-token distribution (weight=0.5)
- **Contrastive loss**: `L_contrast = max(0, margin - ||z_i - z_j||²)` for i≠j (margin=1.0)
- **Prediction diversity metric**: Stop training if <5/24 unique tokens in validation
- **Expected impact**: Break "the" dominance (tested in LOG.md, helped but insufficient alone)

**Success Criteria**: F1 ≥ 6%, diversity ≥ 50%, codebook utilization >50%

---

### Phase 2: Improve Learned Compression (Weeks 4-6)
**Target**: F1 ≥ 15-20% with learned compression

**Action 4: Multi-Depth Latent Adapters (IAA-style)**
- **Motivation**: "TALL" and "Inner Adapter Architecture" show 2-3× improvement via multi-layer injection
- **Architecture**: Insert adapters at layers {5, 10, 15, 20}
  - Layer 5: Low-level token patterns
  - Layer 10: Semantic grouping
  - Layer 15: Task planning
  - Layer 20: Answer formulation
- **Each adapter**: LayerNorm → CrossAttn(hidden, latent) → MLP → gated residual
- **Expected impact**: 2-3× F1 improvement (6% → 15-18%)

**Action 5: Scheduled Sampling (Exposure Bias Fix)**
- **Motivation**: Address 85% train-eval performance gap (LOG.md line 2487-2555)
- **Implementation**: Gradually replace teacher-forced tokens with model's predictions
  - Epoch 1-3: 0% sampling (full teacher forcing)
  - Epoch 4-6: 15% sampling
  - Epoch 7-10: 30% sampling
- **Rationale**: Model sees own predictions during training, reducing train-eval distribution shift
- **Expected impact**: Reduce train-eval gap from 85% to 40-50%

**Success Criteria**: F1 ≥ 15%, diversity ≥ 60%, train-eval gap <50%

---

### Phase 3: Optimize Compression (Weeks 7-9)
**Target**: 4-8× compression at F1 ≥ 50%

**Action 6: Aggressive Quantization**
- fp16 → int6/int4 with group-wise quantization
- Expected savings: 16 bits → 4-6 bits = 2.6-4× reduction

**Action 7: Latent Dimension Tuning**
- Current: M=32, d=256
- Target: M=24, d=192 (1.78× reduction)
- Tune M vs d tradeoff

**Action 8: Hybrid Text+Latent**
- First 8 tokens: Text (critical context)
- Remaining: Latent (bulk information)

**Success Criteria**: 4-8× compression at F1 ≥ 50%

---

### Phase 4: Cross-Model Validation (Weeks 10-11)

**Action 9: Enable Qwen2.5-7B**
- Shared encoder → dual adapters
- Validate cross-model compression

**Action 10: Heterogeneous Ensemble**
- Joint rescoring: Best answer from Llama/Qwen
- Expected: +5-10% over single model

---

## 7. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Post-processing insufficient | Low | Already proven feasible in Phase 1a; worst case: 24% F1 baseline |
| VQ-VAE doesn't fix collapse | **Medium-High** | Untested approach; fallback: multi-depth adapters + diversity reg |
| Multi-depth adapters OOM | Medium | Gradient checkpointing, reduce batch size, limit to 2-3 depths |
| Quantization degrades quality | Medium | Incremental: fp16→int8→int6→int4, stop at acceptable point |
| Cannot beat token-budget (6%) | Medium | If Phase 1-2 fails, pivot to different problem (e.g., KV cache) |

**Timeline**:
- Conservative: 11 weeks (Phase 0: 1 week, Phase 1: 3 weeks, Phase 2: 3 weeks, Phase 3: 3 weeks, Phase 4: 2 weeks)
- Aggressive: 8 weeks (if VQ-VAE succeeds quickly in Phase 1)

**Contingency Plans**:
- If Phase 0 post-processing < 35% F1 → Investigate why extraction fails
- If VQ-VAE (Phase 1) < 6% F1 after 3 weeks → Skip to multi-depth adapters (Phase 2)
- If Phase 2 < 15% F1 → Consider pivot to different compression approach or problem space

**Why NOT Retrying Reconstruction + Generation Loss:**
Phase 1b (LOG.md:3550-3648) showed combining reconstruction and generation objectives causes catastrophic mode collapse (0% F1). Before retrying, would need:
1. **Curriculum**: Train pure reconstruction first (5 epochs), then gradually anneal in generation loss (weight 0.001 → 0.01 over 5 epochs)
2. **Architecture change**: Separate encoder paths for reconstruction vs generation (prevent gradient conflict)
3. **Loss weighting**: Ensure generation contributes <20% of total loss (not 85% like Phase 1b)

Not pursuing this in near-term due to high risk of repeating Phase 1b failure. Post-processing + VQ-VAE + multi-depth are safer bets.

---

## 8. Conclusion

**Summary**: Over 2 months, conducted 50+ experiments across 5 hypotheses, testing 10+ architectural variants and multiple training configurations.

**Achievements**:
1. ✅ Validated embedding interface (82% F1)
2. ✅ Established baselines (text 80%, token-budget 4-6%, Phase 1a 24%)
3. ✅ Diagnosed failure modes (positional information loss, objective conflicts, mode collapse)
4. ✅ Disproved hypotheses (mean pooling, RMS scaling, loss weights)

**Current State**:
- Best result: 24% F1 (answer present, wrong format)
- Learned compression: 0-3% F1 (worse than truncation)
- Clear understanding of what failed and why

**Path Forward**:
- **Phase 0** (1 week): Post-processing Phase 1a → **40-50% F1** (immediate deliverable)
- **Phase 1** (3 weeks): VQ-VAE + diversity → 6% F1 with learned compression
- **Phase 2** (3 weeks): Multi-depth + scheduled sampling → 15-20% F1
- **Phase 3** (3 weeks): Quantization + dimension tuning → 4-8× compression at 50% F1
- **Phase 4** (2 weeks): Cross-model validation

**Recommendation**: Start Phase 0 post-processing immediately (1 week, low risk, high reward: 24% → 40-50% F1). This provides near-term deliverable while pursuing longer-term learned compression improvements.

## 8. Cross-Model Alignment Experiments (October 2025)

### 8.1 Motivation: Cross-LLM Communication via Hidden State Stitching

**Research Question**: Can we align hidden states between heterogeneous LLMs (different architectures, vocabularies) to enable cross-model communication without retokenization?

**Use Case**: Model A processes data, injects hidden states directly into Model B's computation, bypassing tokenization overhead.

**Initial Approach**: Llama 3.1 8B → Mistral 7B v0.3 alignment via learned adapters.

### 8.2 Critical Discovery: Tokenizer Vocabulary Mismatch

**Problem Identified (October 31, 2025)**:

After implementing DDP training and analyzing metrics, discovered a **fundamental vocabulary incompatibility**:

| Model | Vocabulary Size | Tokenizer | Ratio |
|-------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| Llama 3.1 8B | **128,000 tokens** | Tiktoken | **4.0×** |
| Mistral 7B v0.3 | **32,768 tokens** | SentencePiece | **1.0×** |

**Impact on Metrics**:
- Generation Loss: 6.8132 (catastrophic - 10-13× worse than typical 0.5-0.6 convergence)
- Perplexity: ~112 (should be 1.4-1.5 for well-aligned models)
- CKA Similarity: 0.3199 (moderate for cross-family alignment)

**Root Cause**:
- Llama's hidden states encode information for 128K token vocabulary space
- Mistral's decoder expects 32K token vocabulary space
- Adapter trying to bridge incompatible semantic spaces
- No precedent in literature for cross-family transfer with 4× vocab mismatch

### 8.3 Literature Review: Solutions for Cross-Tokenizer Transfer

**Key Finding**: Recent research (2024-2025) has developed methods specifically for vocabulary mismatch:

#### 1. **TokAlign** (ACL 2025)
- **Method**: Learns one-to-one token ID mapping via co-occurrence statistics
- **Results**: Reduces perplexity from 340 → 120 after initialization
- **Benefit**: +4.4% improvement over sentence-level distillation with only 235M tokens
- **Limitation**: Requires retraining embeddings, not direct hidden state stitching

#### 2. **Tokenizer Transplantation** (Arcee.ai, 2024)
- **Method**: Replace smaller model's tokenizer with larger model's tokenizer
- **Tool**: mergekit-tokensurgeon (open-source MergeKit library)
- **Benefit**: Perfect vocabulary alignment enables direct knowledge transfer
- **Limitation**: Requires retraining embedding layer

#### 3. **VocAgnoLM** (Vocabulary-Agnostic Teacher-Guided LM, 2025)
- **Method**: Teacher-student distillation regardless of vocabulary differences
- **Techniques**:
  - Token-level lexical alignment
  - Teacher loss-based guidance
  - Handles token sequence length mismatch
- **Benefit**: Works without modifying tokenizers

#### 4. **MATT** (Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer, 2025)
- **Method**: Exploits model dynamics instead of semantic relationships
- **Benefit**: State-of-the-art results with substantially lower computational cost
- **Approach**: Uses model internals rather than external linguistic knowledge

#### 5. **Parallel Tokenizers** (Cross-Lingual Transfer, 2025)
- **Method**: Train monolingual tokenizers, align via word-level mapping
- **Benefit**: Ensures semantically equivalent tokens across languages
- **Limitation**: Designed for multilingual, not cross-architecture transfer

### 8.4 Why Tokenizer Vocabulary Matters for Hidden State Alignment

**Core Issue**: Tokenization defines the fundamental "units of meaning" the model operates on.

**Impact on Hidden States**:
1. **Semantic Granularity**:
   - 128K vocab: Captures more morphemes in single tokens ("running" as one token)
   - 32K vocab: Splits into subword units ("run" + "##ning")
   - Hidden states encode different semantic chunks

2. **Positional Information**:
   - Same sentence → different sequence lengths
   - "The cat sat" = 3 tokens (128K) vs 5 tokens (32K)
   - Positional embeddings misaligned

3. **Embedding Space Structure**:
   - Llama embedding matrix: [128K, 4096]
   - Mistral embedding matrix: [32K, 4096]
   - Hidden states pull from different embedding neighborhoods

4. **Knowledge Transfer Barrier**:
   - Research quote: "The mismatch in vocabulary hinders deep knowledge transfer between LLMs like token-level distillation"
   - Impossible to align token-level predictions when vocabularies don't correspond

### 8.5 Recommended Compatible Model Pairs

Based on vocabulary compatibility research:

#### **BEST OPTION: Llama Family (Same Tokenizer)**

**Llama 3.1 8B ↔ Llama 3.2 3B** (both 128,256 tokens)
- ✅ Identical tokenizer (perfect alignment)
- ✅ Knowledge distillation used during 3B training from 8B
- ✅ Proven transfer pathway in Meta's architecture
- ✅ Size reduction: 62.5% (8B → 3B)
- ✅ Literature support: "Model Stitching" paper (June 2025) shows within-family transfer works

**Llama 3.1 8B ↔ Llama 3.1 70B** (both 128,256 tokens)
- ✅ Identical tokenizer
- ✅ Same architecture family
- ✅ Proven in model stitching literature (50% FLOPs savings)

#### **VIABLE: Similar Vocabulary Sizes (~128K)**

**Llama 3.1 8B (128K) ↔ Mistral-Nemo-Instruct (131K)**
- ⚠️ Only 2% vocabulary difference (vs 4× mismatch currently)
- ⚠️ Different tokenizers but similar sizes
- ⚠️ Untested in literature

**Llama 3.1 8B (128K) ↔ Ministral-8B-Instruct (131K)**
- ⚠️ Similar vocabulary size
- ⚠️ Same model size (less interesting for compression)

#### **AVOID: Large Vocabulary Mismatches**

- ❌ Llama 3.1 (128K) ↔ Mistral 7B v0.3 (32K) = 4× mismatch (current setup)
- ❌ Qwen 2-7B (152K) ↔ anything else
- ❌ Gemma (256K) ↔ anything else
- ❌ Phi-3 (100K) ↔ Llama 3.1 (128K) = 1.28× mismatch

### 8.6 Proposed Solutions for Current Setup

If continuing with Llama 3.1 8B ↔ Mistral 7B v0.3:

#### **Option 1: Tokenizer Transplantation** (Recommended)
```python
# Use mergekit-tokensurgeon to replace Mistral's tokenizer with Llama's
from mergekit.tokensurgeon import transplant_tokenizer

mistral_aligned = transplant_tokenizer(
    model=mistral_7b,
    new_tokenizer=llama_31_tokenizer,
    reinitialize_embeddings=True
)
```
**Cost**: Requires retraining Mistral's embedding layer (~100M params)

#### **Option 2: Vocabulary-Aware Adapter** (Research Approach)
```python
class VocabAwareAdapter(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_dim, vocab_size_a, vocab_size_b):
        super().__init__()
        # Map hidden states
        self.hidden_adapter = LinearAdapter(hidden_dim)
        # Project vocabulary space: 128K → 32K
        self.vocab_projection = nn.Linear(vocab_size_a, vocab_size_b)
        # Learn token ID alignment via TokAlign
        self.token_mapping = nn.Parameter(torch.eye(vocab_size_b, vocab_size_a))
```

#### **Option 3: VocAgnoLM-Style Distillation**
- Use teacher-student framework with lexical alignment
- Bypass token-level supervision, use sequence-level objectives
- Handles vocabulary mismatch explicitly

#### **Option 4: Switch to Compatible Models** (Simplest)
Use Llama 3.1 8B ↔ Llama 3.2 3B (identical tokenizer, proven pathway).

### 8.7 Revised Success Criteria

Given 4× vocabulary mismatch, adjusted expectations:

| Metric | Ideal (Same Vocab) | Realistic (4× Mismatch) | Current |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|---------|
| Generation Loss | 0.5-0.6 | 4.0-5.0 | 6.8 |
| Perplexity | 1.4-1.5 | 16-32 | 112 |
| CKA Similarity | 0.4-0.6 | 0.35-0.40 | 0.32 |

**If generation loss reaches 4.0-5.0 with current setup, that would be a significant achievement** given the vocabulary incompatibility.

### 8.8 Key Takeaways

1. **Tokenizer vocabulary is critical**: 4× mismatch creates fundamental semantic alignment barrier
2. **Literature gap**: No precedent for cross-family transfer with large vocabulary differences
3. **Solutions exist**: TokAlign, Tokenizer Transplantation, VocAgnoLM (2024-2025 research)
4. **Path forward**: Either use compatible models (Llama 3.1 ↔ Llama 3.2) or implement vocabulary alignment techniques

**Recommendation**: Switch to Llama 3.1 8B ↔ Llama 3.2 3B for immediate success, then return to cross-family transfer as advanced research goal with proper vocabulary alignment techniques.

## Appendix: Metrics Glossary

**F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision/recall for answer overlap (0-100%)
**EM (Exact Match)**: % predictions exactly matching gold answer (0-100%)
**NLL**: Negative log-likelihood per token (lower better, ~2-5 good, >10 poor)
**FirstTok@1**: % first generated token matches gold (0-100%)
**Diversity**: % unique predictions in batch (0-100%, should be >60%)
**Compression**: Input size / output size (higher better, target: 4-8×)

**Cosine Similarity**: Dot product of unit vectors (-1 to 1, where 1=identical)
**PCA Explained Variance**: Fraction of variance captured (0-100%, higher better)
**LoRA**: Low-Rank Adaptation - small trainable adapters for frozen models
**KV Cache**: Key/value matrices stored in transformer for efficiency
