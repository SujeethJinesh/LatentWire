# SSQ-LR

SSQ-LR tests whether recurrent SSM state in hybrid reasoners can be quantized
below FP16 without quality loss during long reasoning.

## Current Readiness

Status: **NEW / Mac gates pending**.

Estimated completion:

- **10%** as a positive-method paper: hypothesis and gates are scaffolded.
- **0%** as a systems-result paper: no native GPU state-cache integration or
  benchmark exists.

## Paper Story

Published systems often leave recurrent SSM state at FP16/FP32 while quantizing
weights, activations, or KV cache. SSQ-LR asks whether a sub-FP16 state recipe
can preserve reasoning quality and reduce state memory/bandwidth in hybrid
Mamba-Transformer models.

## Preregistered Gates

Primary preregistration:

- `phase2/preregister_ssq_lr_20260506.md`

Gate S1 tests state distribution heterogeneity. Gate S2 tests simulated state
quantization sensitivity. Gate S3 tests cross-model transfer without retuning.

## Output Paths

Use:

```text
experimental/ssq_lr/results/ssq_lr_gate_<gate>_<YYYYMMDD>_<model_slug>/
```

## Local Setup

```bash
cd /Users/sujeethjinesh/Desktop/LatentWire
./venv_arm64/bin/python -m pytest experimental/shared/tests -q
```

## GPU Rule

No 5090 work until S1--S3 pass and the exact state quantization recipe is
frozen.
