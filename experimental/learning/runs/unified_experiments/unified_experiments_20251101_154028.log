2. Starting all experiments sequentially (FAST-FIRST ORDER)...
Strategy: Each experiment uses all 4 GPUs for faster completion
NEW PRIORITY: Run FAST experiments first (Procrustes + Activation), then SLOW (trained adapters)
  Phase 1 (FAST): Procrustes + Activation for BOTH model pairs (~30 min)
  Phase 2 (SLOW): LoRA, Linear, Affine on Llama 3.1-3.2 first (~2-3 hours)
  Phase 3 (SLOW): LoRA, Token, Linear, Affine on Llama-Mistral (~2-3 hours)
Benefits: Quick insights + early validation + fail fast on model access


================================================================================
EXPERIMENT 1/11: ACTIVATION COMMUNICATION (LLAMA 3.1-3.2)
================================================================================
Models: Llama 3.1 8B (4096 dim) → Llama 3.2 3B (3072 dim)
Reproducing Ramesh & Li (ICML 2025) - activation injection with learned projection
WHY FIRST: Core feasibility test for cross-model communication
Fixes: Replacement (not addition), last token only, forward hooks, dimension handling


================================================================================
ACTIVATION COMMUNICATION EXPERIMENT (Ramesh & Li 2025 Reproduction)
================================================================================
Model A (source): meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
Model B (target): meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B
Method: Replace target's last-token activation with source's projected activation

TASK-BASED EVALUATION
================================================================================
Evaluating on real tasks (SQuAD Q&A and GSM8K math) to measure task performance
vs exact text matching. This aligns with Ramesh & Li paper methodology.
NOTE: With random/untrained projection, expect low performance on injected model.
      Trained projection achieves up to 27% improvement over natural language (per Ramesh & Li).

  ✓ Injected beats random: True

Interpretation:
  - Injected MUST beat Random to prove meaningful activation transfer
  - Random/untrained projection: Poor performance expected
  - Trained projection (Ramesh & Li): Outperforms natural language communication
  - Goal: Activation communication with less than 1/4 the compute

Next steps:
  ✓ Using trained projection from /projects/m000066/sujinesh/LatentWire/experimental/learning/runs/learned_projection/projection_4096_to_3072.pt
  ✓ Test multiple layers to find optimal injection point
  ✓ Increase sample size for final evaluation (200+ samples)

Models: Llama 3.1 8B (4096 dim) → Mistral 7B (4096 dim)
Tests activation injection across different vocabularies (128K vs 32K tokens)
Expected: Should work since dimensions match (no projection needed)


================================================================================
ACTIVATION COMMUNICATION EXPERIMENT (Ramesh & Li 2025 Reproduction)
================================================================================
Model A (source): meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
Model B (target): mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3
Method: Replace target's last-token activation with source's projected activation

TASK-BASED EVALUATION
================================================================================
Evaluating on real tasks (SQuAD Q&A and GSM8K math) to measure task performance
vs exact text matching. This aligns with Ramesh & Li paper methodology.
NOTE: With random/untrained projection, expect low performance on injected model.
      Trained projection achieves up to 27% improvement over natural language (per Ramesh & Li).

GSM8K Results Summary (20 samples):
======================================================================
  Model B (full context):        Accuracy:  10.0%  ← Upper bound for B
  Model A (full context):        Accuracy:  20.0%  ← Upper bound for A
  Injected (A's activation → B): Accuracy:   0.0%  ← Our method
  Random (noise → B):            Accuracy:   5.0%  ← Control
  No Context (B alone):          Accuracy:   0.0%  ← Lower bound

  Performance Retention (vs Model B):
    Injected: 0.0% retention
    Random:   50.0% retention

  Ramesh & Li (2025): Trained projection outperforms natural language communication

SQuAD Q&A: FAILED

GSM8K Math (20 samples):
  Model B:     10.0%
  Model A:     20.0%
  Injected:    0.0% (0.0% retention)
  Random:      5.0% (50.0% retention)
  No Context:  0.0%
  ✗ Injected does NOT beat random!

Interpretation:
  - Injected MUST beat Random to prove meaningful activation transfer
  - Random/untrained projection: Poor performance expected
  - Trained projection (Ramesh & Li): Outperforms natural language communication
  - Goal: Activation communication with less than 1/4 the compute

Next steps:
  ✓ Models have same dimension - no projection needed
  ✓ Test multiple layers to find optimal injection point
  ✓ Increase sample size for final evaluation (200+ samples)
