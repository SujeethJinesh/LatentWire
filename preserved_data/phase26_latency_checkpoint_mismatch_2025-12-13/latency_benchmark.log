PHASE 1: Training SST-2 Bridge (~3.5 min)
==============================================

/users/sujinesh/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/utils/hub.py:128: FutureWarning: Using `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` is deprecated and will be removed in v5 of Transformers. Use `HF_HOME` instead.

Phase 16: SST-2 Signal Check (CONTINUOUS VERSION)
============================================================

GOAL: Validate bridge can transmit ANY information
  - Task: Binary sentiment classification
  - Success: Accuracy > 50% (random chance)
  - Target: Accuracy > 80% (bridge works)

WHY SST-2:
  - 67,000 training examples (10x more than GSM8K)
  - Binary classification (simpler than math)
  - 'Blurriness' acceptable (unlike exact numbers)

WHY CONTINUOUS (not VQ):
  - VQ collapsed in 7 attempts (perplexity → 1)
  - Continuous soft tokens + batch diversity loss
  - RMS normalization prevents saturation

Training: 2000 steps, batch=8
Diversity weight: 0.1
